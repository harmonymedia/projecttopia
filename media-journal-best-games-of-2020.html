And goodness knows, this is a year when a lot of us needed media to get thru the year. Movies, shows, videogames, and comics helped me get thru a really difficult time, and some of them have become my new favorites.</p><p>This is the third of three best of the year lists to be posted this week. For all three lists, any media is eligible, regardless of what year it came out.</p><p>There's a lot of games on this list that I played and loved but didn't finish. There's also a lot of many-way-ties on this list. 2020 was a year in which escapism via video game was extremely important to me, so it only felt right to represent the games I played this year appropriately.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>1) Sayonara Wild Hearts</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure><p>This was a game I needed to play this year. I actually tried it on Apple Arcade in 2019, thought it was okay but that the controls were a little tricky, then put it down halfway thru. This year, I tried it on Switch, blazed thru it in a single sitting, loved it, played it again the next day. It hit different this time.<br><br>Sayonara Wild Hearts advertises itself as a pop album you can play. It is a lot of things, but gameplay-wise it is mostly in the style of an endless runner, with occasional segments that mix things up a bit. Sayonara Wild Hearts is also a superhero story, a magical tarot-infused dimension-hopping journey, a game about a protagonist who appears to be nonbinary or genderfluid in some way, and - most importantly - a story about loving yourself, even when it's hard.<br><br>Each group of levels has the player character go up against one or more of the protagonist's exes. But this game wasn't just important to me because I went thru some difficult breakups this year. In 2020, I struggled pretty hard with anxiety and depression, and this message of revolutionary self-love was something I needed to be reminded of. It is a magical musical experience. The songs are pretty damn good too.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>2) Super Mario 3D World</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure><p>I was up to my ears in Mario stuff this year (more later on in this list). But the game that delighted me the most, I played on a whim on Wii U at the beginning of the year. Super Mario 3D World easily supplants Super Mario Odyssey as my favorite Mario game of all time. The game is creative, colorful, fun, and deeply addictive. The bonus worlds were way too hard for me, but I've got another chance to take them on when the game comes to Switch in 2021, which I couldn't be more excited for.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>3) Hades</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-3-Hades.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1158" height="608"></figure><p>Positions 3 and 4 on this list are two of the only games here that came out in 2020, and they're on everybody else's Game of the Year lists too. I just don't tend to play too many games in the year they're released, unless they're Nintendo games. The only 2020 triple-A game I tried this year was Marvel's Avengers, which left me super disappointed. I do have a hell of a backlog to dig into next year, tho.<br><br>So, Hades. I'm one of the many people who played this game despite not really liking roguelites. And yet I found myself obsessively playing this game for several weeks until I was able to beat the final boss. The game's Greek mythology definitely doesn't hurt; I'm a sucker for Greek mythology, and the gods' and heroes' depiction in this game are fun and vibrant.<br><br>Mostly, I want to highlight just how fun this game is to control. Each of the six weapons behaves slightly differently, especially once you start unlocking their alternate forms. But all of them are very responsive, flashy, and powerful. Even on runs when I didn't get very far into the game, I had a lot of fun playing as Zagreus.<br><br>I do think it's worth noting that I wouldn't have played the game nearly as much - or maybe at all - without the smart structure of unlocking more things as you continue thru the game. More dialogue choices with characters, more aesthetics for your home base, more powers to play with, and even more romance options to pursue. It hits the 100% completion urge I have with some games, and it also means that regardless of skill level, just by playing the game long enough you'll get better. There's a futility to roguelites that I always struggle with - it's why I've never made it past World 1 of Spelunky - but Hades, despite taking place in Hell, doesn't have that. There's always a new toy to play with.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>4) Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons.JPG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-xs.JPG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-sm.JPG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-md.JPG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-lg.JPG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-xl.JPG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-2xl.JPG 1600w" alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure><p>Believe it or not, for a long time I wasn't sure if this would make my GOTY list. It just felt a little too basic. Like, of course Animal Crossing: New Horizons was a good game. Everybody played it, I was obsessed with it for about three months in the spring, but we all moved on eventually. Could I really call it Game of the Year material?<br><br>Every so often I kept coming back to the game to poke at it, but when the snow hit and the winter holidays came around, I got hooked back in again. Maybe it's just cause I really miss snow, or because I've been stuck in my house so long that I missed fashion and style and wanted to try out some new looks among some virtual friends. It definitely helped, too, that Animal Crossing let me hang out with my partner, who finally got a copy of the game.<br><br>There's a ton of people who've made extremely impressive islands, terraforming everything so that their town looks absolutely perfect. I'm a bit more rugged than that, kind of taking things as they come. But Animal Crossing: New Horizons has been a wonderful place to express myself. I've found it's nice to just hang out on the island doing chores cause I get to do it in a cute outfit and a pink haircut.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>5) TIE: Hitman 2 / The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild /<br></strong><strong>Grand Theft Auto V / Batman: Arkham City / Calico</strong></p><p>Yeah, position 5 is a five-way tie, and our first tie of the list. There's a lot of ties, so... strap in.<br><br>For a long time, I couldn't decide what would make the fifth position. Nothing stuck out at me as, like, "Yes, this is definitely the fifth-best game I played this year, for these reasons." I loved a lot of games, but there were plenty of games that I dipped into for hours, but never actually finished. Games to just lose myself in for a little while.<br><br>So that's what position 5 now is. The games that let me escape and let myself get totally immersed into another world.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1894" height="1020"></figure><p>Let's start with Hitman 2. I've actually been playing levels from Hitman 1, which are available in the (slightly updated) Hitman 2 engine. Hitman levels are a combination of playground, puzzle box, and just a neat place to hang out in and get to know all the nooks and crannies of. I've spent most of my time in Hitman this year getting to know a Parisian mansion hosting a fashion show, and an Italian mansion and the surrounding town that hide a secret laboratory. They've been fun and vibrant locations to master.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure><p>I never finished The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when it first released in 2017. It's an intimidatingly large game. This year, I restarted my save, and came armed with maps and a strategy guide for when I got stuck. They've been a big help to me as I've slowly paved my way thru the game's wilderness. Hyrule is a beautiful world, but I've been glad to be slightly less literally lost in it this time around.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5c-GTA-V.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1858" height="1039"></figure><p>I don't have a ton of amazing things to say about the game design of Grand Theft Auto V. The writing is frequently racist and misogynistic, unfortunately. But I don't really play GTA V to interact with its story. I turn the game on to find a car and drive around a city for a little while - indeed, a fictional version of a city I've lived in. In 2020, that's a type of escapism I needed.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure><br>Batman: Arkham City is a game I've played more than once before, but this year I decided to buckle down and complete all of the secret Riddler challenges hidden within the game, and I just about managed it. I didn't get 100%, but I got pretty close, just enough to finish the mission that allows you to capture the Riddler. It was a nice way to get to know one of my favorite games just a little bit better. I tried the sequels for the first time this year too, Arkham Origins and Arkham Knight. They were alright, but I didn't like them enough to get very far. I'll probably try them another year.<p></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5e-Calico.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1189" height="585"></figure><p>Finally, Calico was a surprise release on Switch at the end of the year that I absolutely adored. It's a very simple little management sim about running a cat cafe. You do little missions for the nearby town, collect animals and furniture to put in your house, and even collect magic spells and potions. It's just the right blend of queer and magical that made me feel extremely at home.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>6) Coffee Talk</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-6-Coffee-Talk.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure><p>There's been a few games in recent years that have taken very basic jobs and built an entire game around them. 2013's Papers Please was the first notable recent game to do so, in which you played a border crossing guard and checked people's paperwork. In 2016, VA-11 Hall-A followed, a game in which you play a bartender in a cyberpunk future. Now we have Coffee Talk, in which you play a barista in an alternate universe populated by fantastical creatures such as orcs, elves, and succubi. <br><br>Having worked as a barista, this was the game of the three that made me feel the most at home, since I've basically done this job. Of course the game mechanics are much simpler than the drink recipes at Starbucks, but I appreciated the low-key atmosphere that pervaded this independently run coffee shop. I liked getting to know everybody, and help along their relationships and goals. I guess this was similar to Animal Crossing as a nice way to experience some semblance of regularity and kindness in a year so devoid of it.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>7) TIE: The Pirate's Fate / Return of the Obra Dinn</strong></p><p>What can I say? This was a good year for pirates, apparently. I also rewatched the entire Pirates of the Caribbean series.

Similar to Breath of the Wild, this intimidated me when it first came out, but I had a lot of fun working out the game's puzzles this year, which were more approachable than I'd expected.

Building, playing, and re-designing this level was a lot of fun; Nintendo really did a clever thing by making not just Lego sculptures, but little building kits that let you re-design levels as much as you like.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>9) Nintendo Labo</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure><p>"Okay," I said to myself just a month or two before the pandemic began and lockdowns started happening.

But regarding the kits themselves, I'll just say that I usually got more fun out of building these things than playing with them. It reminded me of growing up with Lego kits, and getting really excited about the instructions and how the kits were put together.<br><br>I guess the biggest downside is, now I have to find a place to store all this cardboard.

I'm reminded of Thumper as a similar example of, like... just an insane amount of work that's been put into the music and visuals, not to alter the gameplay at all, but just to make the experience that much more powerful.

This was a year where I really valued games that gave me comfort.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 3, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/tags/best-of-the-year/">Best of the Year</a></li><li><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/tags/media-journal/">Media Journal</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/authors/harmony/" class="invert" rel="author">Harmony</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media-journal-best-tv-shows-of-2020.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Media Journal: Best TV Shows of 2020</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/marvel-comics-first-half-of-1998-part-3.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Marvel Comics: First Half of 1998, Part 3 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-01-04T20:05" class="feed__date">January 4, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/best-movies-of-2021.html" class="invert">Best (&amp; Worst) Movies of 2021</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-05T23:04" class="feed__date">April 5, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media-journal-best-of-february-and-march-2021.html" class="invert">Media Journal: Best of February &amp; March 2021</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-02-01T20:39" class="feed__date">February 1, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media-journal-best-of-january-2021.html" class="invert">Media Journal: Best of January 2021</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
