First of all, even the expansive list of games I'll talk about here are a mere fraction of the games I played in 2021. Many were left unfinished, but I still found them interesting enough to talk about.</p><p>I thought I had locked in my game of the year within the first couple of months. Nearly three quarters into the year, it was unseated by what is now the number two slot. And more recently, the number two slot was unseated yet again by this, the most stunning game I played all year: the queer visual novel <strong>Heaven Will Be Mine.</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_title.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1010" height="560"></figure><p>Heaven Will Be Mine is the standalone follow-up to another visual novel which a lot of my friends have played and enjoyed: We Know The Devil, a story about three queer characters who go to summer camp and encounter the Devil. We Know The Devil had a premise that didn't entice me, but when I heard that Heaven Will Be Mine was mostly about cute queer girls in mechs engaging in transhumanism, I couldn't start playing it fast enough. It's like if somebody made Neon Genesis Evangelion with lesbians.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap01.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1314" height="862"></figure><p>Actually, it's even better than that. Heaven Will Be Mine is the story of three girls, at least two of whom are trans, who each act as key agents in a three-way galactic war. Humanity has abandoned Earth, and the galaxy's three main factions all have different ideas about how to proceed with life: return to Earth and embrace their humanity, escape to the stars and embrace a totally different type of nonhuman existence, or find a different sort of in-between existence which respects and remembers their past while still embracing a new future. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap02.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="996" height="546"></figure><p>You play as one of the three girls (Luna-Terra, Saturn, or Pluto) and engage in conversations with the other girls in a visual novel format. During each conversation scene, you're given choices that influence the narrative towards one of four different endings, most of which favor a single faction but one of which is a happy medium between the three. There is emphatically not a canonical ending; even the most balanced one has a degree of uncertainty to it. There is also not a "correct" character to play as; any of the endings can be obtained with any of the playable characters. </p><p>That said, each character also has unique scenes, so there's substantial motivation to try playing as each girl. And I did; I played through the story multiple times to see all the scenes and outcomes, and to get to know each of the characters and their motivations better. This is the only game this year that I restarted as soon as I finished it - multiple times.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap03.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="997" height="557"></figure><p>Even with that amazing premise, Heaven Will Be Mine could have been... just fine, a totally functional queer-girls-in-mechs story, and it probably still would have earned a slot on this list. But Heaven Will Be Mine actually changed me, just as much as the characters themselves are changed in the game. I saw aspects of myself echoed back to me via the characters of Heaven Will Be Mine, aspects that were sometimes painful to confront but that I needed to. These are aspects that could have led to the girls' downfall if any of them had been acting alone - but at the climax, the three characters always work together to lift each other up and build a future together.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap04.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1097" height="614"></figure><p>My GOTY last year was Sayonara Wild Hearts, a game with minimal gameplay but with a story, aesthetic, and message that I really needed to hear in a difficult year. Heaven Will Be Mine is the same thing to me this year. It taught me that love can be more than a feeling: it can be a radical act. It helped me remember who it is that I want to be.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 8, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/tags/best-of-the-year/">Best of the Year</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/authors/harmony/" class="invert" rel="author">Harmony</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/best-books-of-2021.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Best Books of 2021</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-01-06T18:23" class="feed__date">January 6, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/best-books-of-2021.html" class="invert">Best Books of 2021</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-01-05T18:31" class="feed__date">January 5, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/best-and-worst-tv-of-2021.html" class="invert">Best (&amp; Worst) TV of 2021</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-01-04T20:05" class="feed__date">January 4, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/best-movies-of-2021.html" class="invert">Best (&amp; Worst) Movies of 2021</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
