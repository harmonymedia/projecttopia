First of all, even the expansive list of games I'll talk about here are a mere fraction of the games I played in 2021. Many were left unfinished, but I still found them interesting enough to talk about.</p><p>I thought I had locked in my game of the year within the first couple of months. Nearly three quarters into the year, it was unseated by what is now the number two slot. And more recently, the number two slot was unseated yet again by this, the most stunning game I played all year: the queer visual novel <strong>Heaven Will Be Mine.</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_title.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1010" height="560"></figure><p>Heaven Will Be Mine is the standalone follow-up to another visual novel which a lot of my friends have played and enjoyed: We Know The Devil, a story about three queer characters who go to summer camp and encounter the Devil. We Know The Devil had a premise that didn't entice me, but when I heard that Heaven Will Be Mine was mostly about cute queer girls in mechs engaging in transhumanism, I couldn't start playing it fast enough. It's like if somebody made Neon Genesis Evangelion with lesbians.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap01.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1314" height="862"></figure><p>Actually, it's even better than that. Heaven Will Be Mine is the story of three girls, at least two of whom are trans, who each act as key agents in a three-way galactic war. Humanity has abandoned Earth, and the galaxy's three main factions all have different ideas about how to proceed with life: return to Earth and embrace their humanity, escape to the stars and embrace a totally different type of nonhuman existence, or find a different sort of in-between existence which respects and remembers their past while still embracing a new future. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap02.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="996" height="546"></figure><p>You play as one of the three girls (Luna-Terra, Saturn, or Pluto) and engage in conversations with the other girls in a visual novel format. During each conversation scene, you're given choices that influence the narrative towards one of four different endings, most of which favor a single faction but one of which is a happy medium between the three. There is emphatically not a canonical ending; even the most balanced one has a degree of uncertainty to it. There is also not a "correct" character to play as; any of the endings can be obtained with any of the playable characters. </p><p>That said, each character also has unique scenes, so there's substantial motivation to try playing as each girl. And I did; I played through the story multiple times to see all the scenes and outcomes, and to get to know each of the characters and their motivations better. This is the only game this year that I restarted as soon as I finished it - multiple times.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap03.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="997" height="557"></figure><p>Even with that amazing premise, Heaven Will Be Mine could have been... just fine, a totally functional queer-girls-in-mechs story, and it probably still would have earned a slot on this list. But Heaven Will Be Mine actually changed me, just as much as the characters themselves are changed in the game. I saw aspects of myself echoed back to me via the characters of Heaven Will Be Mine, aspects that were sometimes painful to confront but that I needed to. These are aspects that could have led to the girls' downfall if any of them had been acting alone - but at the climax, the three characters always work together to lift each other up and build a future together.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap04.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1097" height="614"></figure><p>My GOTY last year was Sayonara Wild Hearts, a game with minimal gameplay but with a story, aesthetic, and message that I really needed to hear in a difficult year. Heaven Will Be Mine is the same thing to me this year. It taught me that love can be more than a feeling: it can be a radical act. It helped me remember who it is that I want to be.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>#2</strong></p><p>While Heaven Will Be Mine was my favorite overall experience of the year, <strong>Deathloop </strong>had my favorite gameplay of the entire year. I didn't replay it immediately on finishing, because I had too much else to do and also I'd had a great experience in my first playthrough, but I strongly considered it. It was a fantastic game, and in many ways an ideal game for me.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/02deathloop_title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>Now, Deathloop received widespread critical acclaim upon release, but discussion around the game quieted down pretty quickly. I'm pretty sure that's because Deathloop was not widely available to most people. Deathloop was released exclusively to the PS5, a notoriously difficult console to obtain, as well as the PC - and most gamers play on console. Being fortunate enough to own a PC that could run Deathloop, I picked it up on a whim towards the end of September, and was blown away.</p><p>The marketing for this game was pretty bad. For many months leading up to Deathloop's release, the central conceit and gameplay of Deathloop was not clear to me. It seemed to be a multiplayer PvP assassination game, but with time loops involved somehow? A few days before the game's release, reviews cleared things up: Deathloop is a single-player first person stealth assassination game, which has an optional multiplayer element. And I would have loved this to have been clear from the start! I've adored the Hitman games for years; playing Hitman as an FPS sounded amazing.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/02deathloop_cap01.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1087" height="563"></figure><p>And it was! Deathloop is the story of one man, Colt Vahn, who find himself trapped on an island where a large number of people have decided to erect a time loop and party for the same day in perpetuity. Your goal as Colt is to run the loop as many times as it takes until you're able to assassinate all eight targets whose lives are tied to the time loop's existence; kill all eight, and you can break the loop and end the game.</p><p>That's the sort of premise that could seem very overwhelming, especially once I tell you that each day is broken up into four sections, and you have the option of traveling to one of four areas of the island for each island, and the targets move around between the various areas as the day progresses. But it's all right, because Arkane has designed the game to be pretty straightforward and relatively linear. Rather than strategizing the perfect series of kills like you might in Hitman, Deathloop lays out several sidequests called "leads," each of which teaches you how to alter the timeline just right to get your targets into the right places, so you can kill them all in a single run of the loop.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/02deathloop_cap02-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>And once I learned about this, my initial worry was that Deathloop would be too linear. But it's actually a welcome bit of structure that kept me focused on a limited number of questlines, while still allowing a great degree of freedom regarding how I completed them. And there's still plenty of X-factors to keep the game interesting, like the various mooks you'll encounter, as well as the primary antagonist Julia who sometimes shows up to hunt you and completely wreck your plans. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/02deathloop_cap03.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>Deathloop is an extremely playable game. I generally felt like I had a manageable number of tools, but a large sandbox with which to play with them. There's plenty of hidden secrets and a few optional questlines that I was never actually able to finish. And the story does end very abruptly when you finish the game (a point of contention among players), but I found that the story drove the gameplay as much as it needed to and no more. This was an extremely fun world to explore; I especially loved how a mid-afternoon blizzard transformed the world into a quiet peaceful snowscape. I loved uncovering all the game's secrets, getting to know the characters and the locations, and having my own little world to feel a little bit safe in.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>#3</strong></p><p>So, my twice-dethroned GOTY still retains the title of my favorite sandbox of the year. <strong>Hitman 3 </strong>is an incredible achievement, both as a standalone element of a fantastic trilogy, and also as a complete package that includes all 25 levels of the World of Assassination trilogy.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/03hitman_titlejpg.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>When I first found out about the Hitman series reboot, it seemed very much up my alley. Hitman is a stealth assassination game whose main gameplay loop is to find a set of clothes that will get you into a restricted area, get to that area, and then repeat until you're able to get to your target, kill them, and escape the level. Hitman's first game consists of six huge levels with countless assassination opportunities in each level, and encourages replay with an in-game checklist which recommends different types of kills. It emphasizes comedy and player agency above all else. </p><p>My early experience with this game series was attempting to 100% each level's objectives before moving on to the next level - which took a very long time. Early in the year, when Hitman 3 released, I decided to finally run the trilogy, playing each level once and then progressing to the next one in order to sample all of the levels and experience the full story. I played through about twenty levels across three games in quick succession, which was an incredible narrative and gameplay experience.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/03hitman_cap01.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>Hitman 3 kept me coming back for months afterwards, too. In addition to the massive checklists, IO Interactive continually released new limited-time targets over the course of the year, as well as special in-game events. I was addicted to the gameplay of Hitman 3 for months, finally falling off sometime in June. </p><p>Hitman 3 couldn't quite retain its GOTY crown for a couple of reasons. First of all, taken on its own, Hitman 3 is just more Hitman. It's a series of incredible twists on the formula, don't get me wrong; each level seems to be an attempt to adapt a different genre into a Hitman level. The first level's Dubai skyscraper feels like a Mission Impossible movie, the second level's old British Dartmoor mansion plays like an Agatha Christie novel, the third level's dark Berlin rave party is a John Wick movie, etc. And yet despite the brilliance of the level design, and the fun popcorn twists of the story, all of this *is* essentially more of the same Hitman game I've been enjoying for a couple of years now. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/03hitman_cap02.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>Secondly, even grading Hitman 3 based on the quality of the trilogy as a whole (which I could do, since I experienced most of the trilogy for the first time this year, and Hitman 3 does contain the entire trilogy's levels), there just isn't *quite* enough going on to justify it beating Deathloop or Heaven Will Be Mine. It is a fun and funny stealth open world action game that I will enjoy for years to come, but it didn't quite stick to my soul the way those other two games did. No matter; it's still a fantastic game, and a great conclusion to the trilogy.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>#4</strong></p><p>My fourth favorite game of the year is the best writing in any game I played this year. (I told you this year's GOTY list was a difficult battle.) <strong>The Forgotten City </strong>began life as a player-created mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, so within the limited gameplay capabilities of Skyrim's engine, writing was really the only card it could play. Still, what a success: The Forgotten City played its card masterfully, unparalleled to any game I played this year.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/04forgottencity_title.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1091" height="591"></figure><p>In yet another of 2021's many timeloop games (others have discussed this phenomenon at length, so I won't get into it here), the protagonist of The Forgotten City is a modern person who finds themself transported back in time to an underground Roman city. There, the player finds that the city's inhabitants are trapped in this city, and if they break an uncertain code they dub "The Golden Rule," all of them will be slaughtered by the city's golden statues. The city's leader has summoned you from the future and created a stable timeloop because he has learned that somebody will break the Golden Rule, and he tasks you with finding out which individual that could be.</p><p>From there, the game branches out into a web of possible leads or sidequests, helping you learn about the inhabitants' various problems and hopefully solving enough of them that nobody will break the Golden Rule at the end of the day and destroy their world. As with Deathloop, while there are many different paths, the game subtly guides you carefully through the story while still allowing you to follow your whims.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/04forgottencity_cap.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-xs.PNG 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-sm.PNG 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-md.PNG 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-lg.PNG 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-xl.PNG 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-2xl.PNG 1600w" alt="" width="1078" height="604"></figure><p>And the characters' stories are very very compelling. The dialogue is all drenched in Greco-Roman philosophy and mythology. I'm reminded of the philosophical dialogues within the puzzle game The Talos Principle - but whereas that game used philosophical discussion as a mode of self-expression, The Forgotten City is telling a very specific story, and wants to alert you to various thinkers and myths that add color to that story. </p><p>And what a story it is. Late in the game, The Forgotten City reveals itself to be about the trauma of cultural heritage. As the city's secrets are unveiled, The Forgotten City becomes not just a story about myth and philosophy, but a story about how we treat each other, both on an individual level and on a broader societal level. It's a story about the cycle of history that I genuinely did not expect from something that started as a Skyrim mod, and I'll be thinking about its ideas for a long time.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>#5</strong></p><p><strong>Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga</strong> is my favorite platformer of the year.
