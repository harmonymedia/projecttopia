<p>Steve Seagle is such a mixed bag as a writer. I have generally not loved his run on Uncanny, which tends to focus on smaller moments with a small group of characters. I think his writing is stiff and his plots are boring. But then I remembered that Uncanny was the title that did a focus issue on the mutant healer Cecilia Reyes, one of my favorite characters in the current X-Men team. And he forwarded the plot of the X-Men titles by depicting the trial of Gambit in Antarctica. And his one-off story about Jean &amp; Grey fighting a psychic force on an airplane was pretty fun. Uncanny's had some lows (I really didn't care for the number of times it encouraged me to go read Seagle's other book, Alpha Flight), but it's had some decent stuff too.</p>

<p>Here's an oversized one-shot meant to briefly take the place of the recently-cancelled series "Untold Tales of Spider-Man," which featured side stories from early in Spider-Man's career. This one-shot has Spidey and a lot of his supporting cast trapped in a spirit realm along with Doctor Strange for a little while. It's decently fun, the kind of classic fun you'd expect from Kurt Busiek, tempered by the presence of co-writer Roger Stern but brought beautifully to life from the surreal art of Neil Vokes.</p>

<p>First Paul Jenkins writing of the project! I like him, he's generally pretty entertaining, and so is Werewolf By Night. As with Man-Thing, the art is dark and twisted and evocative, and it all illustrates a story where the titular monstrous protagonist must go on a journey to find a bunch of McGuffins in different places. There's a sequence in the middle where werewolf Jack Russell takes a carnival ride to Hell and confronts his inner demons, which is really strong stuff.</p>
<p>Of course the series ends on a cliffhanger, and curiously with the same plot beat that vampire Hannibal King faced in Journey Into Mystery: Jack wakes up to find that he's killed somebody for the first time ever. Kinda feels like that should have come up at some point before in this character's long history?</p>

<p>I started reading with an issue I was really excited for - Tom DeFalco wrote issue #105, which introduces May Parker, the alternate-reality daughter of Peter Parker and Mary Jane. In this issue, she takes up her father's legacy and becomes the new Spider-Girl. Much like Amazing Fantasy, this issue would become so popular that it would spin off into its own series, which would launch later in 1998.<br><br>None of the other issues of What If that I've read reach that high bar, but many come close. I've previously read a few issues of What If from the mid-2000s, and they tend to be pretty dark. But here, What If refuses to ignore these characters' essential goodness and the hope that they represent. <br><br>In one issue, DeFalco wonders what would happen if the X-Men were harder on Gambit after he betrays the team. In the end, they're unable to truly hurt him because he's still their friend. In another issue, Apocalypse turns Wolverine into a brainwashed villain, inadvertently creating an enemy large enough to rally the world against him and bring about an everlasting peace. But that doesn't end in Wolverine's death; it's revealed that he broke free of the brainwashing and is searching for his own inner peace.<br><br>Of course some issues are downers, but in those cases it kinda feels like the characters had it coming. Perhaps the most tragic issue of this bunch is the one starring the Fantastic Four, in which the Thing decides to abandon his teammates for a happy life with Alicia Walters in a tiny villain-created utopia, ignoring the battle they must face and lying to Alicia about the true nature of their peace. The story ends with his teammates dead, Alicia distraught, and the Thing trapped in his false utopia, giving him karmic retribution for his actions.</p>

<p>Even before the X-Men movie in 2000, Wolverine is one of Marvel's most popular characters. So with a Wolverine series, Marvel can do pretty much anything they want. What they've elected to do here is give the reins to a new writer every story arc.<br><br>Warren Ellis takes the first four issues, a tale called "Not Dead Yet" which sees Wolverine tracking down and fighting a murderous asshole he used to go drinking with. The dialogue is sparse but the writing is *on point* and Leinil Yu's art is bold, so it's kinda one of my favorite self-contained arcs I've read in this project.<br><br>After a brief interlude from John Ostrander &amp; Joe Edkin for the annual (it's pretty good, it focuses on Wolverine's ability to lose control), Tom DeFalco takes the reins for a couple of one-off issues. The first one pits him against Roughouse and Bloodscream, two villains DeFalco also used over in Amazing Spider-Man. I don't know why DeFalco cares about them, they're pretty boring. The second is a crossover with Captain America. Both are fine.<br><br>Then Chris Claremont takes over, and... y'know, Claremont's praised as one of the best X-Men writers of all time, but between this and his work over in Fantastic Four this year, I really do not see it. The plot is that Wolverine's been manipulated into making good on a promise he made to marry Viper. Several of the women in his life try to stop him, and Kitty Pryde sticks around for the immediate fallout. It's kind of gross? I mean, Kitty's one of my favorite characters, I'm all for seeing her in more comics, but she kinda just gets used by the villain here, and Viper is just a bitch. And the story's super unfocused too, Wolverine takes an entire issue to mess with some Hydra goons for reasons seemingly unrelated to the main story. Ugh.</p>

<p>For a series that's one of my favorites when it relaunches as a scrappy detective noir series in the 2000s, this iteration of X-Factor is really not doing it for me. There really wasn't a perfect jumping-on point for me to start reading this series cause it's all kind of a mess, so I did the best I could and read these nine issues. <br><br>Maybe the biggest problem of the main stuff is that I just don't care about the main cast. Wildchild, Dark Beast, Alex Summers, and Polaris are all kinda boring. Even Madrox doesn't manage to make things much better in his one appearance. It's a shame because series writer Howard Mackie is also working on adjectiveless Spider-Man, and he's doing a much better job over there. Maybe he was just dealt a bad hand.<br><br>The biggest plot-related thing that happens is a group of mutants from the future called the Xavier Underground Enforcers (not to be confused with the group they split off from, the Xavier Security Enforcers) arrive in the present in the bodies of new people whose identities they've now erased. There's some business where the characters visit the old lives of the people they've bodysnatched and try to make things better, but it's pretty messy.<br><br>The highlight of the series so far might be #147, written by guest writer Joseph Harris, about the mutant Shard trying to help out a bullied kid whose classmates think he's a mutant. Once he finds out he's not a mutant but is actually just double-jointed, he joins in with his classmates to bully Shard. That's a pretty sad but ultimately cohesive little story.</p>

<p>The original point of this comic was that it was Cable's special spin-off team that he led in order to help him stop the bad stuff that would cause chaos in his home timeline. At the point when I started reading, X-Force decided they wanted to do their own thing, and Cable left to have adventures on his own.<br><br>So now X-Force, written almost entirely by John Francis Moore, is the slightly older edition of Generation X: a group of young people dealing with things separately from the main X-Men cast. While Gen X focuses on the whimsy of children, the X-Force team deals with plots and themes more appropriate for its slightly older cast in their teens and 20s. X-Force goes on a road trip, visits a Woodstock-esque festival, and grapples with their inner demons. Warpath has an extended arc in which he seeks out the people who massacred his village, gets killed, and is resurrected. Then Sunspot has a few issues in which he deals with a darker version of himself, Reignfire, who claims to be the same person as Sunspot and briefly possesses him.<br><br>Like with X-Factor, it could be a cast thing, where they haven't really chosen characters that I care about. Maybe if I'd been following since this team debuted in New Mutants Vol 1, I'd be more emotionally invested. I like Domino, but her subplot only shows up every so often.<br><br>It could also be that these characters have enough wealth and power that it doesn't really feel like they're struggling. They go on a cross-country trip without much trouble, and their funding being cut off is only a brief problem. The book just feels kind of dated (which the Woodstock bash doesn't help), and the characters are unlikeable and unrelatable. I hope the series gets better.</p>

<p>This was so close to being my least favorite title of the project. Only Elektra managed to beat it out at the last minute.<br><br>For a start, it's a grim gritty superhero being really really angsty about how cursed he is to have all these superpowers and be such a beloved figure. Literally, there's an arc about halfway thru this stretch where Nate's really angsty about that, and then the Purple Man proves him right by manipulating people to first love him and then hate him. Oh my gods, get over yourself.<br><br>But that's not what makes this series so bad. What I absolutely loathed was how it treats characters with mental illness. In two cases, with the villains Hybrid and Jackknife, Nate makes them more mentally unstable with his psychic powers. Rather than helping them, Nate just hits them for a while until they stop fighting him, either because of serious bodily harm or flat-out disintegration. Nate doesn't really come to terms with what he's done and certainly doesn't seek to make amends. It's just presumed that we won't sympathize with the ultimate fate of the villains because they're, well, *crazy*. And this isn't some kind of undetailed undescribed insanity, either - these characters have clear cases of multiple personality disorder, repression, and schizophrenia. And these characters are left to suffer, even more than before Nate interacted with them. Writer Terry Kavanagh should be ashamed of this work.</p>

<p>This annual is better than the X-Man ongoing because Hulk is in it, mostly calling the shots, and because the villain isn't a mentally ill person but fucking Thanos, still trying to break out of his cosmic prison from the Ka-Zar series. Nate continues to attempt to fuck things up as royally as possible, but Hulk's too competent to be kept down, and Thanos doesn't manage to break out. Thank the gods.</p>

<p>Whereas Uncanny tells little side stories about the main cast of X-Men, the adjectiveless X-Men title is more focused. From month to month, its cast is the main group of X-Men hanging out at the mansion, which is stronger than Uncanny's approach because the main team has a few unusual characters that shake up the dynamic a bit. Specifically, Marrow and Maggot and Cecilia Reyes are all relatively new additions to the team, and a lot of the drama involves them trying and occasionally failing to fit in with their peers.<br><br>Appropriately, this title is also where we get more relevant plot developments. The mutant following the X-Men around who thinks he's a reformed Magneto finds out he's actually somebody else. (This will come back around in an event in a few months.) A call for help that brings Storm and the X-Men to Africa results in Psylocke setting off a massive psychic trap, which is felt by several characters across titles such as X-Man and Generation X. <br><br>It feels like, if you wanted to follow just one X-book to know what was going on at the time, this would be the one you'd pick up. And I really liked it. I think Joe Kelly takes the time he needs to flesh out characters - little interactions like Wolverine bonding with Maggot and Angel talking down Marrow are pretty heartwarming, cause it feels like they're being brought into the fold even tho both Marrow and Maggot look pretty gross and feel like they're outcasts. But then Kelly also folds these into larger plot beats; the oversized 75th issue shows them tracking down the murderers who frarmed Maggot, and it's an appropriate catharsis given how much Maggot's struggled throughout the course of this title.<br><br>So not only is this the essential X-book to read if you only wanted to read one X-book in 1998, but it's my pick for the best of the X-books. All of the other series feel compromised in some way, but X-Men managed to make me love characters I'd never heard of before with kinda gross powersets. That's what X-Men should be at its best - a family where you weren't expecting one.</p>

<p>Because Marvel loves Alpha Flight, here's another X-Men / Alpha Flight crossover, an untold story from early in both team's runs. (This isn't even the first time they've done this, what the heck?) It's fine, and at least Seagle isn't writing this one, but I really question the necessity of so much Alpha Flight if they aren't going to bother to make those characters very likeable or interesting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>X-Men &amp; Dr. Doom Annual 1998</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Men-and-Doctor-Doom-Annual-1998.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Doctor-Doom-Annual-1998-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Doctor-Doom-Annual-1998-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Doctor-Doom-Annual-1998-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Doctor-Doom-Annual-1998-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Doctor-Doom-Annual-1998-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Doctor-Doom-Annual-1998-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="370" height="577"></figure>
<p>It's not a team-up (altho Doom does fight Magneto briefly), it's Doctor Doom going thru the X-Men's history looking for power sources, learning how Onslaught was created, and vowing to use this knowledge at some point in the future. Really, who really knows if that's going to come to fruition, Marvel writers do this a lot where they set up that some villain will follow thru on something and then no future writer is actually interested in doing so. It's not a bad issue but there's not much point to it.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>X-Men Unlimited #18-19</strong></p>

<p>Now, the X-Men have so many characters that there's actually a pretty good reason for them to have a series based entirely in short stories, more so than there is for Spider-Man.<br><br>Issue #19 is a story in which Nightcrawler rescues his love interest from Hell. It doesn't have any immediate consequences in the X-books, but it looks like she's going to stick around.<br><br>Issue #18 has much more immediate and interesting consequences. The B-story is about Marrow, and shows what she's up to when she steals away from the main group of X-Men and hides out in the sewers. It's a really good way of setting up what's going on with her before Angel ultimately confronts her in the main X-books, and made me care just that little bit more about her character.<br><br>The A-story is about Gambit, and the immediate fallout of the X-Men abandoning him in Antarctica. This hit shelves very close to the time when What If did a feature on an alternate reality in which the X-Men swore vengeance against him, and between these two issues, I'm actually pretty hyped to see what'll happen to Gambit next. That may have been the design, because Gambit has an ongoing series that launches later in 1998. But hey, if it works it works. Good showing overall from this title, and a fair bit stronger than Spider-Man Unlimited was.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Next time: </strong>Several long-running series come to a close! The Marvel Knights line starts up, as does Spider-Girl and her various spin-off series! And a Heroes for Hire &amp; Quicksilver crossover event, of all things!</p>

                <p>How do you get into video games if you didn't really grow up with them? I've tried attacking this problem from a number of different angles. One of my strategies is the Retro Games project, another feature of this blog. That project is largely (but not entirely) based around franchises represented in the Super Smash Bros. series, which has become kind of a catch-all for a big section of video gaming.</p>
<p>But I want to rewind to the early 2010s for a minute. In 2012, a friend told me about a bundle of games, some of which I'd heard were modern classics, being sold for very cheap. All of them could run on my underpowered laptop. That bundle was Humble Indie Bundle V.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/humbleindiebundleV-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="433" height="615"></figure>
<p>This was Humble's fifth major project (but 13th overall) bringing together a group of games under a low price to raise money for charity. Pretty much every game in this bundle is fantastic: Psychonauts, Bastion, Amnesia, Limbo, Braid, Superbrothers... it's a gold mine.<br><br>Indie Bundle V was also a good representation of the indie game development boom that began around that time. Thanks to the Xbox 360 and the Steam game store on PC, indie developers had new places to showcase their work. Humble and the indie boom kind of walked hand-in-hand for the next decade; Humble kept bringing together bundles of notable indies, along with the occasional blockbuster title.<br><br>Towards the end of 2015, Humble started another project: a subscription service that provided a grab bag of games every month. It's legitimately a great way to try out some underappreciated games. But here's the thing: I've been subscribed to Humble Monthly for years, but I've been really bad about actually playing the games. I figured it was time for that to change.<br><br>More recently, the Humble Monthly Bundle has required subscribers to choose which games from the bundle to play, rather than giving subscribers all the games. It'd be helpful if there was somebody talking about which games are actually worth playing, wouldn't it?<br><br>SO. This, the latest project of Project-Topia, has two goals every month.<br><br>1) Firstly and most importantly, this overview will rank and review every game in the most recent Humble Monthly Bundle every month. Hopefully this will give subscribers and non-subscribers alike a sense of what all these games are, and whether they're worth picking up.<br><br>2) Secondly, I'm going to be reviewing one retro Humble Bundle every month. For now, that's going to be whatever monthly bundle happened five years ago this month. So this month, I'll be reviewing the January 2021 and January 2016 bundles.<br><br>Everybody following that? Okay, cool. Let's get into it</p>
<p class="align-center"><br><br><strong>HUMBLE JANUARY 2021 BUNDLE</strong></p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>1) PC Building Simulator</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1916" height="1078"></figure>
<p>PC Building Simulator has shown up in my Steam recommendations from time to time, and every time I've thought, this is too ridiculous to exist. Surely the notion of playing a game about building gaming PCs, on a gaming PC, is too far up its own ass to be anything but pretentious and masturbatory. I figured I'd try this once, get the gist, and that'd be enough.<br><br>Out of all the games on this list, I've easily put the most time into PC Building Sim. Several evenings' worth. Cause it's not what I thought it was. I figured it'd be, like, a tool. If you wanted to build a gaming PC, then PC Building Sim could sort of point you in the right direction, or you could pretend to have a nicer PC by playing the game. But it's not that.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><br>In PC Building Simulator, you're running your uncle's PC repair shop. People email you with requests, and then send you their desktop PCs to fix, clean, and upgrade. Eventually, people start asking you to build PCs for them, but not until you put a fair bit of time into the game. Every in-game day you come into work, check your email for new jobs, order new parts for the jobs, and then get to work fixing the PCs that have come in.<br><br>Some of the game is automated; you're not required to know exactly which cable should go where. On the other hand, the game won't let you give the fixed PC back until you've put all the parts in, either, so there's a little bit to learn. You also have to figure out when parts will be compatible with each other. <br><br>It's very easy to get into a routine with this game. It's quite soothing. The in-game radio selection is great, too. I was reminded of Euro Truck Simulator 2. That game does have trucks in it, yes, but it's a compelling long-term experience because you're expected to grow your business with the jobs that you take. Same goes for PC Building Sim: if you only do an okay job, you'll just get PCs that need to be dusted out and de-virused, and it gets boring fast. But if you give your customers amazing service, your rating will go up and you'll start getting new things to do.<br><br>It did not escape me that it was a little weird coming off work in the evenings and booting up PC Building Sim, which is basically another work simulator. But I found this really cozy and endearing. A meditative atmosphere and a good soundtrack do a lot to endear me to a game.</p>
<p class="align-center"><br><br><strong>2) Not Tonight</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble02-NotTonight-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure>
<p>I don't know what it says about me, or maybe about the bundle in general, that my top two games of this group are job simulators. But yeah, here it is: what if Papers Please was set in Brexit.<br><br>Papers Please was a 2013 game in which you played a border crossing guard in the fictional fascist country Arstotzka. The player checks immigrants' IDs and paperwork before deciding whether or not to allow them entry. It was a legitimately fantastic and emotional game with a great core gameplay loop.<br><br>Not Tonight doesn't need to make up a fictional country to depict fascism. That's how far we've come in the last eight years, I guess. You play a person who lives in England but is threatened with deportation unless they show that they can make a living wage. You take jobs as a bouncer at various pubs and clubs, checking people's IDs and tickets to make sure they're allowed entry.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><br>The main gameplay of Not Tonight is verrrry similar to Papers Please. I think Papers Please was perhaps a bit more polished. This game asks you to switch between different gigs, and each gig has different requirements. You also get to spend time at home each day. Papers Please omitted those two things, and instead focused on a really polished and slowly escalating gameplay loop.<br><br>But it's not a bad thing to be a little rougher around the edges. The story of the game is sort of sad and pretty relatable, and I dig it. The pixel art is GORGEOUS. (Gorgeous art is sort of a theme in this bundle.) The music, overheard from each club you stand outside, is wonderful. Not Tonight is a bit more about your story than Papers Please, which was more about the stories of the people around you. I like both approaches for different reasons, and I really liked this game.</p>
<p class="align-center"><br><br><strong>3) Vampire The Masquerade: Shadows of New York</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure>
<p>VTM: Shadows of New York is a well-written and beautifully-drawn visual novel, and that's all it needed to be.<br><br>Vampire: The Masquerade is a tabletop roleplaying game, one of the most famous in the genre along with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Warhammer. But whereas D&amp;D and Warhammer are highly focused on combat, Vampire: The Masquerade takes a slower approach, and puts more emphasis on the stories you can tell within the setting. <br><br>As the title implies, you play a vampire, trying to get by while keeping your existence secret from humans ("the masquerade"). I have some prior experience with the setting, and I've found it to be generally more queer-friendly than other mainstream tabletop settings, too.</p>

And it does that. Shadows of New York follows Julia, a down-on-her-luck young journalist whose life is upended when she's chosen by her local vampire clan. The way that the game parallels the horrors of being a vampire with the horrors of existence in general is very on-the-nose.<br><br>There's not really any choices to make in the gameplay. Occasionally you get to choose Julia's response to other characters, but it doesn't seem to affect much. There's two endings to find, but that doesn't come up until right at the end. Shadows of New York sacrifices personal choice to tell a compelling and self-contained narrative, and I have zero problems with this. I can't get enough of this game's atmosphere and characters.</p>

<p>Every month, Humble releases an original game within its Humble Monthly. Some of these later get wider releases and become major successes, such as A Short Hike, Uurnog, Wilmot's Warehouse, and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. For a Humble Original to rank this high among a group of over a dozen games is a pretty big deal.<br><br>But yeah, here's Heeey! Park-Boy, this month's Humble Original, just below the vampire game and the job sims as my fourth favorite game of the month. The designer, Trey Brown, has said that they wanted to evoke the spirit of weird PS2 games with this game, specifically Katamari Damacy. Well, it worked; this game absolutely charmed my socks off.</p>

<p>You play as a miniscule alien who lands on Earth, in a barren patch of ground. There's a couple of flower buds, so you water them and play music for them. When they bloom, they spit out some more flower buds. Then you water those, slowly growing yourself a little garden park. That's the game.<br><br>It's legitimately fantastic. It's sweet, it's endearing, the music is great, the visuals are pretty whimsical. It's got a bit of a Pikmin vibe to it, albeit a bit jankier. It shows that if you've got a sweet idea and design the game around that, you're gonna hook me pretty good.</p>

<p>Again, this isn't the sort of game I expected to rank very high. In my experience, a low-res game with really simple gameplay, and without any big names behind it, doesn't tend to hold the attention for very long. <br><br>Well, I say without a big name: that's not entirely true. The Ambassador: Fractured Timelines (really? that's the best name they could come up with?) is published by Quantum Astrophysicists Guild. QAG also published Deleveled, which is a little further down on this list, as well as some recent minor indie hits like The Bridge and Tumblestone. But the developer is a very small team making what looks like baby's first action game.<br><br>But... this really really works. The art's pretty basic, but the game is devilishly addictive. When I booted it back up to get some screen grabs, I was playing for several minutes before I realized that I hadn't even gotten any screen captures yet.</p>

Despite all the death, it's not that brutal. You get into sort of a rhythm in each level, trying to figure out the right way to go and testing your reflexes, experimenting with all your weapons.<br><br>There's some games further down this list that have some real money behind them, recognizable name brands and developers. But this little game really worked for me. I'm ranking this list based on how much I wanted to keep playing each game, and The Ambassador keeps drawing me back.</p>

<p>Now comes the point in the post where I admit my lack of gamer cred and say that I've never actually finished a Metroidvania. I've dabbled in a few; the closest I got to finishing one was Metroid: Zero Mission, which I played on an old GBA a couple years back. But I'm not really used to playing this genre, so it's sort of hard for me to tell how good this one is.<br><br>Well, I can evaluate Minoria from more of a novice's perspective, I suppose. Minoria is a 2D sidescrolling Metroidvania with a lot of elements taken from Dark Souls, such as the punishingly hard combat and the bleak red "You Died" game over screen. It's meant as a... follow-up? sequel? spiritual successor? to the Momodora series, which has run for four games now.</p>

Your kingdom has been overrun by evil witches, and it's your job to rescue the princess from the evil forces that have infiltrated the cathedral. Already the game's lost me a little with its premise. If we're doing nuns vs witches, I'm not gonna be inclined to side with the nuns.<br><br>From here, it's standard action platformer stuff. You explore the cathedral for new places to go, fight mooks, discover bosses, and die a lot. That's pretty much the whole game. I'm not quite as compelled to play more of this game as some of the others on this list. I think the art style is somewhere between nice-looking and a little rough, depending on the context. The sound design also sort of varies. It doesn't feel like the game gives you very many toys to play with, at least not at first.<br><br>But, well, it's an exploration game. And there's something pretty addictive to the idea of exploring a space and getting to know it. Color me intrigued enough to mess with this game a little more, but not enough to see it to the ending.</p>

<p>Deleveled is a palindromic puzzle-platformer. I mean that in more ways than just the title. You play as a pair of blue dots navigating a series of levels made from simple geometric shapes. If you can turn on all the switches in the level, you get to move on.<br><br>The levels require that you jump up and down at various heights. But the game doesn't give you a jump button. You get one button to move both dots left, and one to move both dots right. And that's it. If a dot falls onto the other one, it bounces up at exactly the same height. Hence the palindrome, and the puzzle: you have to manipulate the mirrored dots in order to get them to unmirrored positions in the level.</p>

<p>This game is creepy as all hell.<br><br>First, there's a theater. A play went wrong, you're told. You're told to go to a nearby cathedral to ask for another chance. You set out. On the way, you find a village in chaos. People are dying in the streets. At the cathedral, a jury of three. You beg them to try again.<br><br>Soon, you're on a train. Occasionally you have some very creepy dreams, which also serve as a tutorial. Eventually, you arrive in a town - and you're immediately wanted for murder.</p>

As you might guess from the title, it has something to do with disease. It sort of does... eventually. Later in the game, you do have to deal with an outbreak in the town.<br><br>But it's not really about that. Textually, Pathologic 2 is about surviving in a village where you could die at any moment, from hunger, thirst, disease, or your murderous fellow villagers. I have never looked over my shoulder more often in a horror game before. You take sidequests, you seek out the nourishment and supplies you need to survive, and you try to do it all on a ticking time clock. This game is STRESSFUL.</p>

Remember the play gone wrong? There's an implication that this village IS the play. Featureless figures with creepy masks keep popping up. Dialogue scenes are very lyrically written, for how simple their content is. <br><br>I can't escape the sense that this game is inspired by Bertolt Brecht, a playwright form the early 1900s who used absurdism and self-reference as a means of alienating his audience from the material. Brecht wanted his audience to be very aware at all times that they were watching a play, partly as a way to counteract the escapism-heavy Nazi propaganda common in his home country. </p>

<p>More than other games, Pathologic 2 calls attention to its own construction. It clashes the abstract with the intensely real, the poetic with the mundane. You're always questioning the motives of every character in the game, the player character, the game's developers, and even yourself for playing it. Never have I both started and stopped playing a game with the same question in my head: "What IS this?"<br><br>Pathologic 2 is critically acclaimed. I'm impressed by it, even creeped out by it. It intrigues me. But I can't say I really ENJOY this game. Then again, maybe that wasn't the point of it.</p>

<p>My clicking finger hurts.<br><br>If you're not familiar with Diablo, it's a top-down action-based dungeon crawler in which you fight your way thru dungeons full of baddies as one of several fantasy character archetypes. (Wizard, elf, dwarf, etc.) Diablo is often called a loot-em-up because the game generates random loot as your rewards in every dungeon. It's an enormously popular series that's been running since the 1990s, so of course people keep trying to copy it.<br><br>I'm gonna give you a spoiler right now for the rest of this Humble Monthly project: Humble keeps giving me Warhammer games. I have over half a dozen Warhammer games in my Steam library now, and I don't even play Warhammer! With that volume of games, it was probably inevitable that they'd try out the Diablo formula for one of them.<br><br>Surely, by the end of this, I will understand what the hell Warhammer actually is. Warhammer 40K is the slightly more popular version, and that one I'm a LITTLE bit familiar with - it's like, far future war tech stuff, I think. This is really one of my first experiences with vanilla Warhammer. And I'm pretty underwhelmed! It's a pretty basic fantasy action RPG. You can play as an elf, a wizard, a dwarf... if I went from this right to playing Diablo, I'd barely be able to tell the difference.</p>

But here's the thing: it does work. It's VERY pretty - somebody put a lot of money into the graphics. I guess the Warhammer brand has deep pockets. You do have to click the mouse A LOT to do everything - to move, to attack, to pick up objects - and that does start to make my hand sore after a while. Whoops, I've devolved back into snarky words.<br><br>But no, this game does function. And it's at this point in the list because I would enjoy playing it more than I'd enjoy playing the games below this point. And that's the number one criteria for what rank on the list a game receives. Other games below this may have some qualities that are objectively better than Chaosbane, but below this point, it's a struggle to want to play more of them.</p>

<p>I'm gonna be 100% honest with y'all. I wrote the above section, and then I went back into Song of Horror to get some screengrabs and solidify my impressions. And I just did not want to play any more of it.<br><br>Song of Horror is a retro-style horror adventure game. You play with a fixed camera, similar to the Resident Evil and Silent Hill games from the late 90s and early 00s. The game takes place in an old mansion, and you play as one of several different characters investigating the mansion and its inhabitant's recent disappearance.<br><br>Song of Horror was funded thru Kickstarter by a small indie developer from Spain. There is clearly a lot of love for old horror games in the DNA of this game. The idea of selecting your character is interesting, as is the fact that if your character dies, it's for permanent, and you must select another character to continue. Good *ideas* here.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><br>I heard an axiom once that if a game is fun to control, then it's fun to play. (Mario in Super Mario 64, and Link in Breath of the Wild, are proof of this.) Well, this game proves that the opposite of that axiom is also true. Song of Horror is SLOW to control. It's hard to figure out the puzzles in the gloom of the poorly-lit mansion. It's not a very fun area to move around in, and your character has no personality.<br><br>I placed the game this high because, well, maybe there's somebody that this game is for. If you're a HUGE fan of those old horror games, this is a throwback to them. But I didn't find much to enjoy about this. It's a nice idea that doesn't do much to draw me in.</p>

<p>Tales of the Neon Sea is functional, just barely. It's a sidescrolling adventure game where you wander around in a cyberpunk world and find items to fix other items. It just about works.<br><br>So why is this game lower than Song of Horror, a game with a couple interesting ideas that doesn't really work at all? I'll tell you: because Tales of the Neon Sea is SO BORING.</p>

<p>This was somebody's pet project. One person in particular, actually: Patrice Désilets, the creative director of (brace yourself) Assassin's Creed 1 and 2, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.<br><br>Those are some pretty great games, right? Genuine modern classics. Well, after AC Brotherhood, I guess Désilets decided it was time to found his own studio and make his own game. And so we get Ancestors: highly anticipated, and a complete garbage fire of a game.<br><br>In Ancestors (once you've survived the long unskippable opening cutscene), you play as an ape, one member of a small clan. As the title implies, you are the ancestors of humans. It's your job to learn about the world around you, what foods to eat, how to use weapons, and so on. Your behavior is reflected in your clan, so they'll learn new behaviors along with you.</p>

That is TOO MANY buttons. But that part doesn't actually surprise me. The movement controls of the original Assassin's Creed games are, like... weird. You had to hold down two or three buttons in order to run across roofs and parkour off walls. There was a bit of skill to getting used to some weird controls. But Ancestors doesn't really bring that together; there's just too many buttons to remember.<br><br>Even if you can remember all those buttons, the gameplay loop is essentially to investigate every single thing in the world. There's not really any choices to make, either; this isn't like Spore, where you can evolve in different directions. You're always going towards being more human; the only question is how good or bad you are at it.<br><br>So: awkward controls, pretentious story, boring game design, shoddy graphics. Nothing about this game works. It is a fascinating failed experiment that somebody put way too much money into.</p>

A bit like Myst, a bit like Portal, but with no puzzle concepts that are all that original. The Talos Principle is about moving boxes, reflecting lasers, and making copies of yourself to solve puzzles. It's very very basic.<br><br>But it's also meditative as hell. You have conversations with an AI. You explore ruins of old civilizations - Greek, Egyptian, and Medieval Europe. You find fragments of philosophical text and scientific journals. <br><br>In the margins of the puzzles, you're questioning the nature of your own existence and surroundings - both within the game and without it. But the majority of the game *is* the puzzles. It's like the game gives you some big things to think about, and then has you do some puzzles to occupy another part of your brain while you think about those things.<br><br>In construction, Talos Principle seems basic on the surface. But it is such a transcendentally good experience, I can't say enough good things about it.</p>

<p>Mushroom 11 might be the only game I know where you play as an eraser. Well, sort of. You play as a slime mold, but you have no way of actually controlling it. Your method of interaction with the game is a large circle that allows you to erase parts of the slime mold that interact with it. The catch is, once you erase part of the mold, it will regenerate somewhere else on the mold, randomly. This is effectively how you move around: erase part of the mold, thus forcing the mold to regrow in the direction you want it to go.</p>

<p>I know this game is a classic. I know some people swear by Spelunky. Mark Brown brings it up nearly every episode in his Game Maker's Toolkit video essay series. But I just can't do it.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble05-Spelunky-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-Spelunky-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-Spelunky-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-Spelunky-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-Spelunky-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-Spelunky-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-Spelunky-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure><br>It's very pretty, and it's very polished. But an action platformer that randomly generates is punishingly difficult for me. I've only ever clicked with one roguelite before, Hades, and that game did give you some sort of progression most times you played it. With Spelunky, there's only so much you can learn about the game before your progress is determined by your skill in playing it. <br><br>It changed the face of indie gaming, and I'm glad that it's worked for some people. But it's not for me.</p>

<p>A Fistful of Gun is clearly intended to be sort of an arcade experience. It prominently displays its arcade option in the main menu, and when you die you get a slow countdown from 10 if you want to restart, like in an arcade. It's clearly meant to be a light shooter that doesn't take too much effort to play.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble05-AFistfulOfGun-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-AFistfulOfGun-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-AFistfulOfGun-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-AFistfulOfGun-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-AFistfulOfGun-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-AFistfulOfGun-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble05-AFistfulOfGun-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><br>Shame it doesn't really work. The characters aren't very much fun to play; they're all pretty finnicky. In contrast, the enemies are very fast, and the game clearly wants you to keep up a fast pace.<br><br>There's a story, about finding an evil bad guy in the Wild West, but it's basically an excuse to play thru a bunch of random maps. For a game that wants to be so low effort, it's remarkably unfun to play.</p>

So, no Marvel Comics, manga, retro games, or media from the unnamed project launching (hopefully) later this week will be included in this list.<br><br>But even besides those, I found a lot of media this month worth talking about, so let's dig in.</p>

<p>As part of my plans for 2021, I thought it was time I got started on reading again, starting my own personal book-of-the-month club. Reading books is usually pretty hard for me, but one book a month? That I can do, especially when the list of books I've been wanting to read has grown so much over the last year or so.<br><br>I'm starting with The Lightning Thief, the first in Rick Riordan's multi-series franchise, published in 2005. Now, I have read this book before, when my sister had the original hardcover printing on her shelf. But at the time, I wasn't intending to read further. This time, I'm interested in the full series. <br><br>The Lightning Thief kicks off a five-book series called Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians, a modern YA take on Greek mythology. It's followed by two sequel series, and Rick Riordan has since branched out into writing trilogies about Egyptian and Norse mythology. He's also brought other writers in to write books inspired by mythology from at least a dozen other sources, from Aztec to Santeria. It's a fascinating spread that I'm eager to dig into.<br><br>The original book doesn't yet betray these ambitions. The Lightning Thief came right in the middle of what I remember as a scramble to find the next Harry Potter series. Alongside The Lightning Thief came the Charlie Bone books (2002), the Artemis Fowl series (2001), Eragon (2002), the Bartimaeus trilogy (2003), and for adults, Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell (2004) and Lev Grossman's The Magicians (2009).<br><br>It has almost the same initial structure as Harry Potter. Percy Jackson is a teenager who constantly seems to get into trouble (or, as he would describe it, trouble finds him). On a fateful stormy night, he's whisked away from his abusive family into a school for magic. He soon begins a quest alongside his two new best friends: a brainy girl, and a boy who is frequently the comedic relief.<br><br>There's wrinkles to this formula that are better than Rowling's Potter series. I don't remember the last time I read a series, for kids no less, where the main character is mentally disabled. Percy Jackson has ADHD and dyslexia, and this comes up regularly, first as a weakness in the mundane world, and then as a strength in the magical one. The closest to this that I can remember reading is the critically acclaimed "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time," which was very much *about* the main character's autism. Here, Percy has these mental illnesses, it is something that he wrestles with, but it's far from the book's focus.<br><br>I think, for what it's worth, Riordan is better than Rowling at writing a supporting cast that all seem to have their own agendas. Outside of Harry, we didn't really get a sense of what Ron and Hermione and the others around him hoped for and were striving for; they kind of got pulled along for the ride. Here, Percy's two friends have goals of their own, and they interweave with the main storyline in interesting ways. Grover, a satyr who's been tasked with looking out for Percy, wishes to prove himself so that he can begin an ancient quest to find the deity of the satyrs, Pan. Annabeth, daughter of Athena, longs for adventure, and uses Percy's quest as an excuse to find some. And it's not just these two: every minor character seems to have an agenda of their own, regardless of their position in the story. Rowling was good at writing character's affects, but Riordan is better at suggesting his characters' inner lives.<br><br>Now, a word about the depiction of the Greek mythological figures, places, and situations that the kids find themselves running into. They are okay. It's really not my favorite "it's the gods but now it's contemporary" depiction I've ever seen. The Wicked + The Divine, a favorite graphic novel of mine, did an amazing job. The video game Hades, last year, did an amazing job. American Gods, a mid-2000s novel by Neil Gaiman, did a pretty good job. I feel like some of the depictions here could be just a bit more inspired. The land of the Lotus Eaters, from The Odyssey, is now a Vegas casino. Ares is now a biker, and Poseidon is a surfer dude. It does work, but it feels like sometimes Riordan is going for the most obvious "the gods, but now it's modern" example he can think of.<br><br>But there's touches I do like, and the overall cosmology of the series is built on rock-solid ground. As the demigod trainer Chiron explains partway into the book, gods are egregoric beings, and thus can't really die. They just move to wherever the heart of Western civilization, as the world sees it, exists at any given time. So, Mount Olympus now resides in New York City, and the entrance to the Underworld can be found in - where else? - Los Angeles.<br><br>So with that in mind, here's why, to me, The Lightning Thief ultimately works really really well. Cause, yeah, in basic structure, it starts out as almost a clone of Harry Potter. Just because Percy ends up in a summer camp rather than a boarding school doesn't mean the similarities aren't there. But the further into the book you go, the more those similarities fall away. Percy and his friends don't stay at the school once the call to adventure reaches them. They take a road trip, and encounter more and more elements of classic mythology that now reside in America. One sidequest is a direct reference to Hephaestus finding Ares and Aphrodite sleeping together, in which the gods involved try to change the outcome of that story by using our three heroes as bait. At another point, the kids find and slay Medusa. The arrival at the Lotus Hotel &amp; Casino really tips you off to what's going on. The Lightning Thief has ceased to be a Harry Potter book, and is now a direct reference to stories of heroic quests across the Greek mythological landscape, such as The Odyssey and Perseus.<br><br>By the end, when Percy and his friends are confronting gods and villains in order to finish off the story, it feels like a clash of narrative titans. What happens when you take the "kids go to magic school" story - which by 2005 was already a well-established story - and bring them into conflict with mythological narratives? Well... both end up being changed in really interesting ways. The Lightning Thief doesn't really end in a way that's satisfying for either a Harry Potter story or a Greek myth, instead coming to an interesting and somewhat anticlimactic compromise. And with a group of characters that are already this rock-solid, it makes me think further books in the series are going to be even more interesting. We've done The Odyssey now - what's next?</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>Shadow of the Batgirl</strong></p>

<p>Batman is only as interesting as the people around him. When you write Batman alone, you write a grim broody guy with absolutely no self-awareness and only one emotion. I've read that story a million times.<br><br>The Batman that's intrigued me most in recent years is the one found in Scott Snyder's run, beginning in the New 52 reboot in the early 2010s. That Batman frequently interacted with his team: fellow Robins (of which there's almost half a dozen now), Justice League coworkers, and various Bat-themed heroes who operate in Gotham. If Gotham's such a crime-ridden city, it only makes sense to try to make things better as a team and as a family, right?<br><br>One of the members of the Bat-family was Cassandra Cain, a mute girl who's taken on the Batgirl moniker. I've never seen her get a series of her own, but here's a YA graphic novel that depicts how she might have come to inherit the cowl.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-interior.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-interior-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-interior-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-interior-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-interior-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-interior-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-interior-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="476" height="716"></figure><br>The storyline is simple. Cassandra escapes her abusive father and winds up in a library, where she overhears Barbara Gordon (formely Batgirl, but now in a wheelchair for reasons not brought up in this comic) talking about heroism. With the help of Barbara, and a ramen store owner named Jacqueline, Cassandra figures out how to build herself up, learn who she wants to be, and eventually take on the mantle of Batgirl.<br><br>There's not very many details to pick thru in this book; it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from that premise. But I can't say enough good things about it. The art is gorgeous, flowy and full of character in every panel. Cassandra's struggles as she learns to communicate with other people are depicted with a lot of heart. The action is amazingly good.<br><br>I've said a lot of times how I think the superhero genre works well with the teenage coming-of-age story common in YA books. This is a really good example of that. Cassandra coming into her own and crafting a new identity for herself works great for both genres, and is the basis for an absolutely beautiful graphic novel.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the month, Netflix announced an animated film adaptation of The Witch Boy, a graphic novel from Molly Knox Ostertag. Molly is the wife of Noelle Stevenson, who's known for their critically acclaimed comic Lumberjanes, and more recently for showrunning the Netflix animated show She-Ra &amp; the Princesses of Power, one of my favorite shows of the last few years. So of course, I had to check this out.<br><br>The Witch Boy is the most transgender narrative I've ever seen that isn't *explicitly* about being trans. (Well, okay, it ties with The Matrix.) In a small settlement in the woods, children are brought up to learn magic. Boys are brought up to become shapeshifters and learn to fight demons, whereas girls learn witchcraft. Our hero, Aster, doesn't want to learn shapeshifting, and definitely doesn't want to fight. He just wants to learn witchcraft with the other girls. But everybody around him, parents and friends alike, insist that this isn't allowed. They bring up an ancestor of theirs who tried this thing and ended up with terrible evil powers. Aster is forbidden from learning that which calls to him.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="567" height="861"></figure>
<p>A despondent Aster decides to learn anyway, and his path ends up crossing with a non-magical human, who encourages him. When the boys in the settlement start disappearing, the two friends take it upon themselves to figure out what's going on, mostly by using witchcraft. And that's pretty much the bulk of the story. It's meant for young readers, so in some ways, the ending will be pretty predictable to most readers. And yet in other ways, it surprised me.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior2.JPG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior2-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior2-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior2-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior2-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior2-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-interior2-2xl.JPG 1600w"  alt="" width="466" height="753"></figure><br>This is a powerful narrative to give to children. Aster is never explicitly called transgender, but he is clearly gender-nonconforming. Aster doesn't have a traditionally masculine or feminine name; "Aster" is a genus of flower, the sort of gender-ambiguous noun that I've seen in many of my nonbinary friends. His visual appearance also leans feminine: long ponytail, light purple clothing. Most importantly, over and over in the narrative it's reinforced that Aster feels more comfortable in the girls' group. I wish the story had gone just one step farther and actually used trans-positive language, but it's still a deeply powerful story about being who you are, even when everyone around you tells you no. I'm glad Molly wrote it, and I'm excited about it getting a potentially even wider audience with its Netflix adaptation. This was a treat.</p>

<p>I've never heard of "chunibyo," but apparently this is a thing in Japan. "Chunibyo" is a term that loosely means "middle school disease," and it was coined as a term for kids in middle school who let their imaginations get away with them, believing they have magical powers or are from other worlds.<br><br>"Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions" is a 2011 show by Kyoto Animation, a studio critically acclaimed for classics like "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" and more recent series such as "Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid." It follows a group of characters afflicted by chunibyo as they enter high school. It's sort of meant as a deconstruction of the concept, but it accidentally introduced the term to more people outside of Japan, including myself. I found the show deeply endearing.<br><br>One of the two leads, Yuta Togashi, is embarrassed of his middle school mage persona "Dark Flame Master," and just wants to forget about it. He quickly comes into conflict with Rikka Takanashi, a high school freshman who still believes she has magical powers, including a "Wicked Eye." Yuta is embarrassed by Rikka, but the two end up spending a lot of time together, slowly warming to each other, and bringing each further into the other's world. If that's not a great setup for a teen romance story, I don't know what is.</p>

Even though our POV character Yuta is embarrassed about his past chunibyo life, the show really isn't embarrassed about the concept at all. When Rikka and other characters go to great lengths to play pretend, we do get some cutaways showing what's actually going on, but we also get some lovely and frequently over-the-top animation showing the world they're seeing.<br><br>And what Yuta learns over time is that there's a really good reason Rikka's still a chuuni. The more time Yuta spends with Rikka and her sister, the more he learns that Rikka went thru some deeply traumatizing experiences, and chunibyo helped her cope and try to move on. When Yuta and Rikka ultimately fall in love, he still gets embarrassed about her over-the-top displays sometimes, but he takes part in her delusions almost as frequently. Rikka's imagination is treated as a beautiful and important part of her.<br><br>So yeah, this show is silly. But it's also sweet, it has a wonderful cast and a light tone, and it's a great story about the power of imagination. I haven't quite finished it - along with two full seasons, there's two films and a couple dozen shorts. But what I've seen so far is a really good argument for becoming one of my new favorite shows of all time.</p>

<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is BACK, except this time it's not in cinemas! Maybe they should change that name for Phase 4, which has more television projects than film projects currently planned.<br><br>For the first time since Spider-Man: Far From Home, almost two years ago, we get new stories in the universe of the Avengers films that have been running in theaters since 2008. Other projects had planned release dates before WandaVision, including the Black Widow movie and the Falcon &amp; Winter Soldier series, but I think this was a perfect start to the new MCU era for a lot of reasons. It's been a great way to start my Friday mornings.<br><br>In the four episodes that have aired to date (nearly half the series), the witch Wanda Maximoff and android Vision find themselves in the world of a sitcom from the mid 20th century. Each episode echoes a new decade: so far we've seen takes on I Love Lucy (the 50s), Bewitched (the 60s), and The Brady Bunch (the 70s). Wanda and Vision don't seem to realize that they're actually Avengers from the 21st century; they play their parts as the two leads of this constantly-evolving sitcom.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage.JPG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-2xl.JPG 1600w"  alt="" width="906" height="669"></figure><br>Except, they sort of do realize they're out of place. There's a lot of recurring plot elements, within the sitcom, about Wanda and Vision trying to fit in. Both characters retain their identities as a witch and a robot, two nonhuman people trying to fit in in a very mundane world. In the first episode, Vision tries to convince his boss that he's worth keeping around via a fancy home-cooked dinner; in the second episode, Wanda and Vision try to put on a magic show without revealing that they have actual magic powers. On its own terms, it's legitimately clever stuff.<br><br>And then the cracks start to show. Of course, the audience knows that something's very wrong, so it's a matter of time before Wanda and Vision, and even the people around them, start to realize that this sitcom world isn't real, or at least is hiding some sort of secret. How those cracks reveal themselves is part of the fun of the show, and there's a LOT to theorize about, whether you're a fan of the comics or not. I've got some pretty good guesses as to where this is all leading, but there's still a fair few elements that haven't fallen into place yet. <br><br>The whole thing is a LOT of fun - as a throwback sitcom, as a mystery, as the latest element of the Marvel Cinematic/(Televisual?) Universe. We've got as many as ten projects in the MCU planned for this year, and I couldn't be more excited.</p>

<p>I can't help but feel that this movie would have been received better if everybody had been able to see it at once. Tenet was originally scheduled for a summer 2020 release. At Nolan's insistence, it was finally released in theaters towards the end of August, received a DVD and digital purchase release around Christmas, and only now - at the beginning of January - did it FINALLY receive a non-cost prohibitive rental release date. So only now are most people actually finally seeing it.<br><br>Here's the thing about Tenet: for me, this film works best in Youtube clip form. That isn't the insult that it may seem to be. I mentioned in my best of the year list for 2020 that Youtube clips of The Good Place finally convinced me to go back and finish that show. Tenet is the sort of film that BEGS to be analyzed and picked apart, so that people can actually understand what's going on. I have now seen countless Youtube clips explaining the events of the film in every possible way, and it took all of that analysis for me to basically understand the plot.<br><br>At the VERY least, with how bad the sound mixing is, you need captions to understand the film. And it certainly helps not to be sitting in a theater, anxious for two and a half hours about the possibility of catching a deadly disease.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-Tenetimage2.JPG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-2xl.JPG 1600w"  alt="" width="1212" height="552"></figure><br>Let's strip away the pretension inherent in a Christopher Nolan movie to talk about this film for a second, in as basic terms as possible. Tenet is a time travel movie. Nolan's been trying to talk around this genre designation in just about all the marketing I've seen. It's presented as a movie about "time inversion." Nah, bullshit. This movie only starts making a lick of sense when you start understanding it as a time travel movie.<br><br>Imagine for a second that Marty McFly got into the Delorean in Back to the Future and activated its time travel device. But instead of sending him to a specific point in the timeline, Marty and the Delorean started moving backwards in time, at the same rate that they were previously moving forwards in time. That's what time inversion is. It's time travel, at a rate of one second per second, in the opposite direction you were previously going. It does let you get to other points on your timeline, just very slowly. That's all it is.<br><br>I watched this movie with my roommates, and the first night we only got thru half of it before we couldn't watch any more, because of how boring it was. The next night, we picked it up at the halfway point, a climactic car chase. And what do you know, the halfway point is where the film gets GOOD, especially since by that point, I'd spent a lot of time on Youtube learning about the mechanics of the time inversion. It really did help to have at least one person in the room actually understanding what was going on.<br><br>The premise is, our hero, pretentiously named "The Protagonist," is brought into a secret society to investigate the origins of a number of objects (mostly weapons) that have been "inverted" in time. These objects don't move thru time the way most people do, but originated from the future and are now moving backwards in time. The secret society believes that these objects are from a war in the future.</p>

The plot is bad. And also, it doesn't matter. It's an excuse, even within the story, to get the characters to the places they need to be for some cool stuff to happen. There's a car chase, a fistfight, a large-scale battle. It WOULD be your basic action movie stuff, but Nolan uses every opportunity to film things in reverse, which creates a lot of visual interest and excitement - even the things you've seen before, you're never quite sure how they're gonna go. I mean that in multiple senses.<br><br>Look: this movie isn't great. It's not close to Nolan's best work. But I've gotten less enjoyment out of Nolan movies before. I thought Dunkirk was sort of boring, and Interstellar kind of lost me. As a puzzle to unwind, Tenet is fun, and I'll be honest: there aren't a lot of blockbusters out there that present themselves as puzzles to unwind. The final action sequence of the movie has editing that reminds me strongly of my favorite webcomic, Homestuck, which is known for its experimental storytelling and non-chronological shenanigans. I'm not saying I got a lot out of this movie... but I honestly did get a fair bit of fun out of it.</p>

<p>Studio Trigger made a movie! Well, okay, they've made movies before actually. My favorite show of theirs, Little Witch Academia, originally existed as two medium-length animated films, before it was greenlit for a full series. So okay, I'll be a bit more specific: Promare is Trigger's first feature-length film, that is intended to be told merely as a feature-length film. There, I think that works better.<br><br>In an alternate future, some humans (called Burnish) have developed a mutation that causes them to spontaneously combust. Our heroes are a group of firefighters with weapons-grade tech (sort of like cops in our world) which allow them to put out the fires started by these people. When our hero Galo comes into contact with a rogue group of Burnish and their leader Lio, he learns that things aren't what they seem, and the world is actually on the brink of apocalypse.</p>

They've always tended towards this style, but the Gurren Lagann-meets-Kill la Kill aesthetic of the film really pushes this pretty far. There's extended shots that are nothing but pulsing abstract geometrical shapes, but thru context you still understand what's going on.<br><br>It's also, of course, a standard over-the-top Trigger anime. Trigger has stayed away from its mech anime origins for most of its 8-year existence, but in the last couple years it's gone all in. Promare, Darling in the Franxx, and SSSS.Gridman are all mech anime.<br><br>I have to admit that I might be just a little bit too gay for this show. Oh, it's very gay; its two male leads are very clearly in love with each other, and they even kiss. But I think I related better to some of the more female-driven shows that Trigger's made, especially Little Witch Academia and Brand New Animal. I can't really fault the movie itself, it's damn good, but I know it's resonated more with other audiences.</p>

<p>I'm legitimately astounded that this game exists. If Found is one of the newest games published by Annapurna Interactive, one of my favorite game publishers. Every game of theirs that I've played has been interesting, and nearly every one has become one of my new favorite games. I have high expectations for Annapurna... but this game still blew me away.<br><br>Released early in 2020, If Found is... sort of a visual novel? You play as... well, it's unclear. But you're reading the diary of Kasio, a young transgender woman living in Ireland in 1993. And you're also reading the story (somehow) of an astronaut in space, investigating a black hole.<br><br>But you don't advance the story by clicking thru it, or even by turning pages. You advance the story by erasing it. So, haunting you in the background of the entire story is: why? Why is this the main gameplay mechanic? It is a fascinating mechanic, and they keep finding new twists on it that makes the 2-3 hour length interesting, but... surely there's a reason for it.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-IfFoundimage.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure><br>It probably has something to do with Kasio's story. Kasio is a trans woman who is rejected by her parents and runs away. She moves into an abandoned house with a young queer band. As she wrestles with her own identity, she's also forced to grapple with how it affects her relationship to her family, her friends, and her larger community.<br><br>I don't know how much of this story is autobiographical. I presume a nonzero amount. It's too accurate to experiences I'm intimately familiar with to be otherwise. Many, many trans people I know have gone thru the sort of familial and community strife and rejection depicted in this game just by coming out. It's also not uncommon for newly out trans people to find a new queer family, which also happens in this game. These are fairly universal experiences for trans people. <br><br>For this story, which is deeply heartfelt in its specifics but also very universal as a trans experience, to be published by a MAJOR independent developer like Annapurna, is honestly so astoundingly wonderful that I don't know how to react. I just want to tell everybody: please play this. It is not very long, and it is wonderful. Playing this with my roommate at 5 in the morning was a deeply emotional experience, and I'll treasure it for a long time.</p>

<p>This is another Annapurna Interactive game, and... look, okay, I'm kind of an Annapurna fangirl. One of their games, Sayonara Wild Hearts, was my game of the year last year. Gorogoa and What Remains of Edith Finch are both among the best gaming experiences I've ever had. If Found, as I wrote above, was... absurdly wonderful.<br><br>Outer Wilds, what I've played of it so far, is by contrast *merely* an astonishing yet somewhat overwhelming open-world space exploration mystery game. The bar for Annapurna games is so high that "this is a phenomenal game, and yet it's a little hard for me to get into" is a step DOWN.<br><br>You play as a (nonhuman) space explorer who lives on a small planet in a small solar system. You take off in your spaceship and start exploring the other planets to see what else you can find. Twenty minutes later, the sun explodes, time rewinds, and you're back on your home planet, with a twenty minute timer until it all happens again.</p>

<p>Early in Outer Wilds, you're required to explore a small museum before you're allowed to blast off into space. I think that's the moment when I realized that this game is an archaeology simulator. It's a mystery game where the way you figure out what's going on is you explore other planets to figure out what happened to the other residents of the solar system, past and present.<br><br>It's not just the time limit that makes this game overwhelming to me. Nearly every location in this game is hazardous in some way. On one planet, an underground labyrinth slowly fills with sand until you're crushed against the ceiling. On another, take a wrong step and you'll fall into a black hole that teleports you into the middle of nowhere. This game is *hard*. <br><br>And there's not a ton of direction it gives you at the outset. Y'know how The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild at least gives you "go to these four locations and activate the Divine Beasts" objective, to guide you thru its huge open world? Outer Wilds sort of does that, but... not really. You get a few objectives to go for at the beginning, but the people you find at those objectives just give you some more cryptic clues. It really is up to you to divine the general shape of the game, bounce between exploring various locations, and eventually... well, do something to end the game. It's unclear.<br><br>I haven't finished this game. I don't know *if* I will, to be completely honest. Of the Annapurna games I've played, it's my least favorite. But that's a very relative term. I love the tone, somewhere between chill as heck and dangerous as hell. I love the art style, which seems simple at first but is in fact very carefully designed. I love puttering around the map in my little spaceship, at least until I take a wrong turn and accidentally fall into the sun. This game is... it's a trip, y'all, but I do recommend at least trying it. Who knows, maybe you'll find a little fun here.</p>

<p>Here it is. The finale to IO Interactive's five-year-long "World of Assassination" trilogy. I've put dozens of hours into this series, but until now, I'd actually only played the first few levels of Hitman 1. I like to 100% things, see, and I love getting to know every nook and cranny of a space. That's why I spend so much time with Batman: Arkham Asylum whenever I play it. So I've been spending a good deal of time ferreting out every challenge and everything hidden in the first few levels of Hitman 1.<br><br>When Hitman 3 released, I decided it was time to start playing thru all of the levels, and try each one at least once before returning to my more methodical play style. I've been very very excited about the new levels (including an old mansion murder mystery) and the resolution to the story.<br><br>The thing is, I'm so behind, that this month all I've been able to play so far is the levels of Hitman 1 and 2. That's the Paris mansion, an Italian villa, a Morrocan embassy, a hotel in Bangkok, a farm in Colorado, a high-tech hospital in Japan, a small house on the coast of New Zealand, a racetrack in Miami, a drug cartel in Colombia, the streets of Mumbai, a suburban block in the US, and a secret society's castle island headquarters.</p>

But what I learned with this is, playing thru each level of these games once gives you an honestly pretty meaty experience. The final level of Hitman 2 (not counting the DLC) took me two and a half hours to complete. These levels take *time* to play.<br><br>But it's worth it. You honestly get a pretty good experience playing thru it like this; if nothing else, you get to see all the cutscenes between levels in a short period of time, which makes the story a bit easier to follow. It's also a pretty solid difficulty curve. The two US levels in Hitman 2 are pretty easy, and the other levels are all pretty hard, with the final level being the most difficult one.<br><br>I'm excited as heck to play thru these levels again, and start uncovering all their secrets. But before that, in February, I'll be playing the levels that are new to Hitman 3 (plus the Hitman 2 DLC). That's a New York bank vault, an island resort, a Dubai skyscraper, an old English mansion, the streets of Berlin and the streets of China, and... I'm not sure what else. IO Interactive has been very careful about not spoiling the last couple levels of the series. <br><br>But I'm very excited. Very few other games that I've played have this much love put into every single level. There's a huge amount of care and work that's been put into the design of these games, and I'm so glad that IO was actually able to finish the trilogy. Next month, it'll be time for me to finish it, too.</p>

<p>The first half of this short-lived title is a Spider-Man series that's solid at best. A supervillain called the Authority sends Spider-Man on a cross-country wild goose chase, battling various villains and teaming up with varous heroes. At the very end, he sends Spider-Man to go get a magical artifact, which of course he wants to use for nefarious purposes, so Spidey lets the artifact's original owner, the Watcher, have it back. It's fine.<br><br>Halfway thru the series, Namor returns from the Heroes Reborn/Return event, and after a Spider-Man/Namor crossover issue, Spider-Man disappears and the book becomes a Namor team-up book. This part of the series is far more interesting, cause Namor doesn't get his own series all that often. Over the course of four issues, Namor fights off attackers to Atlantis and reclaims the throne. And whereas for the Spider-Man issues, Spidey teamed up with different characters because he was in a different country every month, in the Namor issues the second team-up character keeps changing because nobody can stand to be around him longer than a single issue. I liked having him around, though. Give us more Namor titles, Marvel!</p>

<p>Somebody at Marvel decided it'd be a good idea to do an anthology title with stories from various settings and time periods in the Marvel Universe. On its own, that's not a particularly bad idea. But the first three-issue arc has been dreadful.<br><br>Besides the specific writing talents of Roger Stern, or lack thereof, I think two factors combined to make Marvel Universe an incredibly dull read. The first was the decision to stretch out each story into a several-issue multi-parter. It's not the only anthology title this year to do so - Journey Into Mystery took the same approach - but it hampers the book's stated ability to jump around and change subject very frequently.<br><br>The second poor choice was to start with a story about the Invaders, an Avengers-style team from the 1940s: Namor, Captain America, and an android Human Torch (predating the Human Torch of the Fantastic Four). I'm always up for more Namor, but at this point I feel like I've read stories about the Invaders SO many times. <br><br>It is kind of cool to see Steve Epting drawing this era here, a few years before he would be called on to draw WWII-era Marvel again for Brubaker's Captain America run in the mid 2000s. But the only new twist Roger Stern can think of for this story is that Baron Von Strucker got access to Doctor Doom's time machine, and uses it to Back-To-The-Future-Part-2 himself some atomic bombs. Come on.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>Maverick vol 2 #1-12</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Maverick-vol-2-1-12.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Maverick-vol-2-1-12-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Maverick-vol-2-1-12-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Maverick-vol-2-1-12-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Maverick-vol-2-1-12-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Maverick-vol-2-1-12-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Maverick-vol-2-1-12-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="2396" height="1246"></figure>
<p>I'm kind of perplexed as to why this series even exists. Here's Maverick, a guy wearing at least three times as much garishly-colored armor as is necessary, clearly a relic of the grim and gritty mid-90s that's mostly been abandoned by 1998, and Marvel's given him an entire ongoing series of his own. They don't really care about this being friendly to new fans, either - this follows directly from his one-shot in 1997 and his single appearance in the short story compilation X-Men Unlimited, and the cover doesn't really give you an indication of what kind of hero he is. What gives?<br><br>This is exactly the sort of title I should hate, cause grim gritty superheroes and their angst get old REAL fast. But Maverick's plotline is fairly straightforward, and Jorge Gonzales' writing isn't overly wordy, so it's a reasonably breezy read. <br><br>The plot hook for this ongoing series is that cancer-afflicted mutant Maverick suddenly goes into remission and gains new superpowers, giving him a new lease on life. There's a multi-part backup story in which Maverick's young ward gets his own adventures, which is mystifying, because none of this series' characters are memorable at all. Most perplexing of all, though, is the ending. As with many new series, Maverick builds up to a climax in issue twelve, wherein all the main enemies are defeated. But at the end of the issue, Maverick finds himself stranded in a snowy mountain range with no visible hope of rescue.<br><br>This isn't Maverick's last-ever appearance in Marvel Comics - he'll be back in a few years as a regular cast member of Weapon X Vol 2 - but it is his last ongoing series, and presumably the last appearance of his supporting cast, with whom he gets no reconciliation after the bad guys are defeated. If you know it's gonna be your series finale, why not tie it up in a bow? I'm looking at you too, Elektra.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>Moon Knight vol 3 #1-4</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1590" height="612"></figure>
<p>Here's another title way better than it has any right to be. Character creator Doug Moench is given a four-issue miniseries to resurrect Moon Knight since he was killed in his last adventures.<br><br>The fun part about Moon Knight is the series' questions about belief and identity. It's pretty unclear for most of the series what motivates Moon Knight - is he actually gifted with divine power, or is he deluded? Once he stops asking questions and starts believing in himself, none of that matters anymore.<br><br>I also like that Moon Knight has multiple personalities. This is sort of quietly a thing in a lot of superhero comics - are Bruce Wayne and Batman actually the same person, or are they two distinct personalities? - but in situations where a character explicitly has multiple personalities, they aren't usually written very well. Compare the heroic Moon Knight here to the villainous and murderous Typhoid Mary over in Deadpool, for example.<br><br>Moon Knight is one of the only series this year that made me want to go back and read his older series at some point. The character and the series are haunting and dreamlike and super story-rich, and I dug the fuck out of them.</p>

<p>Quicksilver isn't the kind of mutant I generally give a shit about, and I certainly wasn't looking forward to reading an entire series devoted to him. But luckily the writers cram so much other interesting stuff into the comic that I didn't care that Pietro Maximoff is kinda dull.<br><br>In the very first issue, Quicksilver teams up with the Knights of Wundagore, a group of animals who have been evolved to a more anthropomorphized form and who are capable of speaking English. In other words, this ongoing Quicksilver series has a bunch of furries in it. And they're totally endearing! After this cast is spotlighted in the first few issues, they get their own subplots running thru the background of later issues. I loved them.<br><br>Only four issues in, Quicksilver's wife Crystal (hey look, it's another late 90s married superhero couple!) brings him to meet her Inhuman family at New Attilan on the moon. And this also is a lot of fun - the Inhumans have good visual design and some neat family drama. Also Crystal is just kind of a lovable character. Basically, anything in this series that didn't have much to do with Quicksilver, I loved, and there was quite a lot of that.</p>

<p>Here's a second Hulk series that Marvel apparently intended to be an ongoing series (although it only lasted for six issues). This issue takes place in the past, so it has nothing to do with current continuity, only reminding you of a time when things were simpler and General Ross &amp; Hulk hated each other.</p>

<p>The spaceship on the cover of the Seeker 3000 comics looks a lot like the Enterprise from Star Trek, so I went in presuming this would be some new parody or ripoff of that story. It turned out to be something kind of different.<br><br>So back in the 1970s, Marvel had an anthology title called Marvel Premiere, which switched up its protagonist on a regular basis. After the release of Star Wars, Marvel looked for ways to cash in on audience appetite for stories in outer space. One of these attempts was Marvel Premiere #41, a self-contained story about a spaceship containing the last of the human race as they flee Earth and its dying sun. This is the issue reprinted in Seeker 3000 Premiere.<br><br>I almost didn't pick this series up, cause it's pretty hard to find. But one of the new series' writers is Dan Abnett, co-writer of a lot of contemporary Marvel cosmic stuff, including the modern reboot of the Guardians of the Galaxy.<br><br>I'm glad I found these issues, cause the writing in Seeker 3000 is good stuff. The plot involves various human and alien factions, but its complexity is contrasted with the ease and humanity with which Abnett writes dialogue. The first issue of the new series is quite long, but it blows by; the characters and their relationships are engaging.</p>

<p>If you're reading all four Spider-Man books in 1998, Sensational is the first one to come out each month, so it kinda sets the tone for the rest of the month.<br><br>Most Spider-Man comics are about relationships - the character has a huge supporting cast, so his series tend to be even more soap opera-y than other Marvel comics. But I think the most unique thing I can say about Sensational is that it makes Spider-Man's relationships integral to the plot. <br><br>Here's a couple of examples. The identity that writer Todd Dezago comes up with for Identity Crisis is the Hornet, a Beetle-esque persona, and it's enabled via the Prowler's tech. Later on, Dezago's resolution to the Hornet's storyline comes when the Vulture fights him and recognizes that the Hornet is Spider-Man within about two minutes.</p>

<p>Silver Surfer is J.M. DeMatteis' second project, along with Man-Thing. It's more accessible than Man-Thing, but still tackles some big ideas about the nature of existence thru a superheroic lens.<br><br>I started reading in the arc when Surfer dies and is subsequently brought back to life, though not without tussling with Mephisto. The next two Silver Surfer villains both want to allow humanity to ascend to a higher plane of existence, which basically means turning them into living energy. Surfer is tempted, and is thrown into the Macroverse, a beautifully-rendered plane of existence that allows him to surf across many universes all at once. It's kind of like if an indie director was suddenly given the reins to a blockbuster movie franchise like Star Wars, and it's breathtakingly beautiful at times.</p>

<p>Rather than slot this annual into DeMatteis' main epic storyline, DeFalco pops in to write this one-off issue wherein Thor and Surfer team up against a cosmic villain. It's not bad.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>Spectacular Spider-Man #255-260</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Spectacular-Spider-Man-255-260.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spectacular-Spider-Man-255-260-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spectacular-Spider-Man-255-260-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spectacular-Spider-Man-255-260-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spectacular-Spider-Man-255-260-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spectacular-Spider-Man-255-260-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spectacular-Spider-Man-255-260-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="7680" height="1968"></figure>
<p>In the aftermath of the Clone Saga, which wrapped up in 1997, the biggest unresolved plot thread is Norman Osborn, returned from the dead and not only having escaped justice for his crimes as the Green Goblin, but in a position of power as the owner of the Daily Bugle. Spectacular is the only Spider-title to really deal with this plot thread on a monthly basis. It also is the last Spider-title to come out every month, so it had to wrap up both the Spider-Hunt and Identity Crisis events.<br><br>Perhaps relatedly, Spectacular can't manage to keep a consistent writer on the title, at least in the stretch of issues I read. Tom DeFalco, J.M. DeMatteis, Glenn Greenberg, and Roger Stern all contribute to this stretch. It's easily the most uneven Spider-comic of the four (DeMatteis really has a completely different sensibility from the others), but it's still a totally engaging entry in the Spider-Man soap opera, and it's pretty exciting to see Norman Osborn getting potentially closer to his eventualy comeuppance.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>Spider-Man</strong> <strong>#89-94</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Spider-Man-89-94.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="7696" height="1960"></figure>
<p>The adjectiveless Spider-Man title easily takes the most risks of any of the current Spider-Man titles. Howard Mackie's idea for a new identity is Dusk, a moniker that Spider-Man takes on while helping out a rebellion inside the Negative Zone. Dusk allies with supervillain Paste-Pot Pete, making Dusk the most (relatively) antiheroic of the four new Spider-identities.<br><br>Mackie also does a one-off story called "Who Was Joey Z?", which sees Spider-Man and Jill Stacy separately investigating the identity of a supervillain's henchman. There's also a really good issue starring Ghost Rider. And all of this is drawn by John Romita Jr., easily one of the best artists of Spider-Man and indeed in all of comics. If I had to pick a favorite of the four Spider-titles, it might be this one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>Spider-Man: Made Men #!</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Spider-Man-Made-Men-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-Made-Men-1-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-Made-Men-1-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-Made-Men-1-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-Made-Men-1-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-Made-Men-1-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-Made-Men-1-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="247" height="383"></figure>
<p>From the same writer as the adjectiveless Spider-Man title comes this oversized, occasionally-prose one shot about two brothers who find themselves under the employ of Wilson Fisk and the FBI respectively. It's a haunting tale about how the soap opera drama of superheroes and supervillains affects the people around them. Strong stuff.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>Spider-Man Unlimited #20-21</strong></p>

<p>The "Unlimited" line, currently featuring this title and "X-Men Unlimited," is a place for writers to do one-off stories with the characters. These two issues are handled by writer Chris Golden, who takes the opportunity to pit Spider-Man against some classic horror movie monsters: a zombie and the daughter of Dracula in #20, and Frankenstein's monster in #21. For me, I preferred the second issue; sexy vampire girl was *just* edged out by Frankenstein's monster and his surprising humanity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>Strange Tales: Dark Corners #1</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Strange-Tales-Dark-Corners-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Strange-Tales-Dark-Corners-1-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Strange-Tales-Dark-Corners-1-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Strange-Tales-Dark-Corners-1-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Strange-Tales-Dark-Corners-1-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Strange-Tales-Dark-Corners-1-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Strange-Tales-Dark-Corners-1-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="256" height="392"></figure>
<p>Here's a one-shot featuring stories of three characters who don't have their own title at the moment: Cloak &amp; Dagger, Morbius, and Gargoyle.<br><br>From worst to best: the Morbius story is about a dozen pages of him spying on his ex-fiancee while she works. It is gross. The Gargoyle story is evocative, especially with its painterly art, and it was very nearly my favorite of the bunch. Unfortunately, there's not much point to the story except to set up an appearance in Silver Surfer.<br><br>So my favorite story in the issue ended up being Cloak &amp; Dagger - perhaps predictable, since I have a soft spot for those two. But it's also the most competently written story - the heroes infiltrate and break up a gang preying on children and bring them to a foster home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>Thor vol 2 #1-2</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Thor-vol-2-1-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="449" height="349"></figure>
<p>It's hard to tell how this title will turn out - so far it's a pretty solid Thor title and not much more. Dan Jurgens' big twist is to give Thor a new secret identity; in the first two issues, Thor dies and is sent to hell, and is brought back to life by merging with a recently deceased paramedic. Could be either really good or really frustrating.</p>

<p>Here's the best-conceived and at times best-written series in 1998, I think. The hook is this: in the aftermath of Onslaught and the disappearance of major heroes like the Avengers and Fantastic Four, a new team of superheroes called the Thunderbolts appear and quickly come to prominence. These heroes are actually supervillains in disguise, under the direction of Baron Von Zemo. Their plan is to ingratiate themselves to the public just long enough to gain access to secret files only superheroes have access to, and use them to take over the world.<br><br>But here's the twist: in the process of pretending to be superheroes, many of the supervillains find out that they actually do want to reform and be better people. So the question of the book is, now that they've been given this chance, how many of them (if any) will be able to be the heroes they want to be deep down?<br><br>Busiek throws a LOT at these characters in the first twelve issues. They rescue and recruit a young superhero named Jolt who doesn't know that they're supervillains. (This provides the plot hook of the Annual - Baron Von Zemo tells Jolt her teammates' origins, but twists their stories to hide their true nature as villains in disguise.) Black Widow shows up and warns them to stay on the straight-and-narrow, having figured out they're actually villains. They fight off a supervillain team who took their old supervillain team name, the Masters of Evil, which tempts Zemo to reveal themselves.<br><br>And then, merely ten issues in, Zemo learns of discord within the group, and reveals the Thunderbolts' status as "reformed" villains to the world, forcing the team to stick by Zemo rather than be caught by the authorities. This plays into the publishing phenomenon I mentioned before where new series usually build to a climax by the end of the first year. By the end of issue twelve, the Thunderbolts have fought and then teamed up with the Avengers, broken free of Zemo's clutches, and gone on the run. <br><br>It's hard to say if the second year is as good as the first, yet. Now under the direction of Moonstone, the Thunderbolts have done some pretty shitty things, including destabilizing an entire planet in order to get back home to Earth. The tension now seems to be whether they can stick together under the manipulative direction of Moonstone, and whether they'll survive an impending conflict with Zemo. But I'm hooked. I love the characters and the premise, I think Busiek does more with this comic than he's doing anywhere else in 1998, and I'm excited to see this team continue on for a hundred more issues. To me, this is the best comic I've read for this project to date.</p>

                <p>It's become a yearly tradition for me to put together a Best Of The Year list for the media I enjoyed in that year. And goodness knows, this is a year when a lot of us needed media to get thru the year. Movies, shows, videogames, and comics helped me get thru a really difficult time, and some of them have become my new favorites.</p>
<p>This is the third of three best of the year lists to be posted this week. For all three lists, any media is eligible, regardless of what year it came out.</p>
<p>There's a lot of games on this list that I played and loved but didn't finish. There's also a lot of many-way-ties on this list. 2020 was a year in which escapism via video game was extremely important to me, so it only felt right to represent the games I played this year appropriately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>1) Sayonara Wild Hearts</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>This was a game I needed to play this year. I actually tried it on Apple Arcade in 2019, thought it was okay but that the controls were a little tricky, then put it down halfway thru. This year, I tried it on Switch, blazed thru it in a single sitting, loved it, played it again the next day. It hit different this time.<br><br>Sayonara Wild Hearts advertises itself as a pop album you can play. It is a lot of things, but gameplay-wise it is mostly in the style of an endless runner, with occasional segments that mix things up a bit. Sayonara Wild Hearts is also a superhero story, a magical tarot-infused dimension-hopping journey, a game about a protagonist who appears to be nonbinary or genderfluid in some way, and - most importantly - a story about loving yourself, even when it's hard.<br><br>Each group of levels has the player character go up against one or more of the protagonist's exes. But this game wasn't just important to me because I went thru some difficult breakups this year. In 2020, I struggled pretty hard with anxiety and depression, and this message of revolutionary self-love was something I needed to be reminded of. It is a magical musical experience. The songs are pretty damn good too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>2) Super Mario 3D World</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>I was up to my ears in Mario stuff this year (more later on in this list). But the game that delighted me the most, I played on a whim on Wii U at the beginning of the year. Super Mario 3D World easily supplants Super Mario Odyssey as my favorite Mario game of all time. The game is creative, colorful, fun, and deeply addictive. The bonus worlds were way too hard for me, but I've got another chance to take them on when the game comes to Switch in 2021, which I couldn't be more excited for.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>3) Hades</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-3-Hades.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1158" height="608"></figure>
<p>Positions 3 and 4 on this list are two of the only games here that came out in 2020, and they're on everybody else's Game of the Year lists too. I just don't tend to play too many games in the year they're released, unless they're Nintendo games. The only 2020 triple-A game I tried this year was Marvel's Avengers, which left me super disappointed. I do have a hell of a backlog to dig into next year, tho.<br><br>So, Hades. I'm one of the many people who played this game despite not really liking roguelites. And yet I found myself obsessively playing this game for several weeks until I was able to beat the final boss. The game's Greek mythology definitely doesn't hurt; I'm a sucker for Greek mythology, and the gods' and heroes' depiction in this game are fun and vibrant.<br><br>Mostly, I want to highlight just how fun this game is to control. Each of the six weapons behaves slightly differently, especially once you start unlocking their alternate forms. But all of them are very responsive, flashy, and powerful. Even on runs when I didn't get very far into the game, I had a lot of fun playing as Zagreus.<br><br>I do think it's worth noting that I wouldn't have played the game nearly as much - or maybe at all - without the smart structure of unlocking more things as you continue thru the game. More dialogue choices with characters, more aesthetics for your home base, more powers to play with, and even more romance options to pursue. It hits the 100% completion urge I have with some games, and it also means that regardless of skill level, just by playing the game long enough you'll get better. There's a futility to roguelites that I always struggle with - it's why I've never made it past World 1 of Spelunky - but Hades, despite taking place in Hell, doesn't have that. There's always a new toy to play with.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, for a long time I wasn't sure if this would make my GOTY list. It just felt a little too basic. Like, of course Animal Crossing: New Horizons was a good game. Everybody played it, I was obsessed with it for about three months in the spring, but we all moved on eventually. Could I really call it Game of the Year material?<br><br>Every so often I kept coming back to the game to poke at it, but when the snow hit and the winter holidays came around, I got hooked back in again. Maybe it's just cause I really miss snow, or because I've been stuck in my house so long that I missed fashion and style and wanted to try out some new looks among some virtual friends. It definitely helped, too, that Animal Crossing let me hang out with my partner, who finally got a copy of the game.<br><br>There's a ton of people who've made extremely impressive islands, terraforming everything so that their town looks absolutely perfect. I'm a bit more rugged than that, kind of taking things as they come. But Animal Crossing: New Horizons has been a wonderful place to express myself. I've found it's nice to just hang out on the island doing chores cause I get to do it in a cute outfit and a pink haircut.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>5) TIE: Hitman 2 / The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild / <br></strong><strong>Grand Theft Auto V / Batman: Arkham City / Calico</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, position 5 is a five-way tie, and our first tie of the list. There's a lot of ties, so... strap in.<br><br>For a long time, I couldn't decide what would make the fifth position. Nothing stuck out at me as, like, "Yes, this is definitely the fifth-best game I played this year, for these reasons." I loved a lot of games, but there were plenty of games that I dipped into for hours, but never actually finished. Games to just lose myself in for a little while.<br><br>So that's what position 5 now is. The games that let me escape and let myself get totally immersed into another world.</p>

<p>Let's start with Hitman 2. I've actually been playing levels from Hitman 1, which are available in the (slightly updated) Hitman 2 engine. Hitman levels are a combination of playground, puzzle box, and just a neat place to hang out in and get to know all the nooks and crannies of. I've spent most of my time in Hitman this year getting to know a Parisian mansion hosting a fashion show, and an Italian mansion and the surrounding town that hide a secret laboratory. They've been fun and vibrant locations to master.</p>

<p>I never finished The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when it first released in 2017. It's an intimidatingly large game. This year, I restarted my save, and came armed with maps and a strategy guide for when I got stuck. They've been a big help to me as I've slowly paved my way thru the game's wilderness. Hyrule is a beautiful world, but I've been glad to be slightly less literally lost in it this time around.</p>

<p>I don't have a ton of amazing things to say about the game design of Grand Theft Auto V. The writing is frequently racist and misogynistic, unfortunately. But I don't really play GTA V to interact with its story. I turn the game on to find a car and drive around a city for a little while - indeed, a fictional version of a city I've lived in. In 2020, that's a type of escapism I needed.</p>

I didn't get 100%, but I got pretty close, just enough to finish the mission that allows you to capture the Riddler. It was a nice way to get to know one of my favorite games just a little bit better. I tried the sequels for the first time this year too, Arkham Origins and Arkham Knight. They were alright, but I didn't like them enough to get very far. I'll probably try them another year.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5e-Calico.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1189" height="585"></figure>
<p>Finally, Calico was a surprise release on Switch at the end of the year that I absolutely adored. It's a very simple little management sim about running a cat cafe. You do little missions for the nearby town, collect animals and furniture to put in your house, and even collect magic spells and potions. It's just the right blend of queer and magical that made me feel extremely at home.</p>

<p>There's been a few games in recent years that have taken very basic jobs and built an entire game around them. 2013's Papers Please was the first notable recent game to do so, in which you played a border crossing guard and checked people's paperwork. In 2016, VA-11 Hall-A followed, a game in which you play a bartender in a cyberpunk future. Now we have Coffee Talk, in which you play a barista in an alternate universe populated by fantastical creatures such as orcs, elves, and succubi. <br><br>Having worked as a barista, this was the game of the three that made me feel the most at home, since I've basically done this job. Of course the game mechanics are much simpler than the drink recipes at Starbucks, but I appreciated the low-key atmosphere that pervaded this independently run coffee shop. I liked getting to know everybody, and help along their relationships and goals. I guess this was similar to Animal Crossing as a nice way to experience some semblance of regularity and kindness in a year so devoid of it.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>7) TIE: The Pirate's Fate / Return of the Obra Dinn</strong></p>
<p>What can I say? This was a good year for pirates, apparently. I also rewatched the entire Pirates of the Caribbean series. I guess I was just kind of in a mood.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-7a-The-Pirates-Fate.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7a-The-Pirates-Fate-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7a-The-Pirates-Fate-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7a-The-Pirates-Fate-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7a-The-Pirates-Fate-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7a-The-Pirates-Fate-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7a-The-Pirates-Fate-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1533" height="1069"></figure>
<p>The Pirate's Fate is a visual novel in which you play a lioness who gets adopted into a small pirate crew. As you explore the world for cursed treasure, you and your crewmates undergo various transformations, which change depending on your choices. I liked the characters a lot, I liked the transformations, and I appreciated that this game celebrated many different body types.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-7b-Return-of-the-Obra-Dinn.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7b-Return-of-the-Obra-Dinn-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7b-Return-of-the-Obra-Dinn-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7b-Return-of-the-Obra-Dinn-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7b-Return-of-the-Obra-Dinn-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7b-Return-of-the-Obra-Dinn-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-7b-Return-of-the-Obra-Dinn-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>Return of the Obra Dinn is a landmark puzzle game (by the same designer as Papers Please, actually) in which you explore an abandoned ship to find out what happened to its missing crew of several dozen. Similar to Breath of the Wild, this intimidated me when it first came out, but I had a lot of fun working out the game's puzzles this year, which were more approachable than I'd expected. Still haven't finished the game, but maybe when I try it for the third time, I'll finally finish it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>8) TIE: Super Mario 64 / New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe / <br>Super Mario Bros. 35 / Lego Super Mario</strong></p>
<p>This was also a really good year for Mario. After finishing Super Mario 3D World very early in the year, I decided I wanted to try some other Mario games, and this is what I came up with.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-8a-SM-64-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8a-SM-64-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8a-SM-64-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8a-SM-64-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8a-SM-64-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8a-SM-64-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8a-SM-64-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>Super Mario 64 was released as part of a compilation on Switch halfway thru the year, and I've been slowly plugging away at its collectibles. It is a lot more awkward to control than I expected it to be, after all of the praise I've heard from this game over the last couple of decades. But even in its simple design, it's a strangely charming game. I've enjoyed slowly exploring to find all the secrets this game is hiding.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-8b-NSMB-U-Deluxe.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8b-NSMB-U-Deluxe-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8b-NSMB-U-Deluxe-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8b-NSMB-U-Deluxe-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8b-NSMB-U-Deluxe-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8b-NSMB-U-Deluxe-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8b-NSMB-U-Deluxe-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe (whew) is a Switch port of a Wii U game, and it is yet another release of classic style 2D Mario platforming. I barreled thru this game to play as much as I could, but ended up getting tired of it about halfway thru. It's generally fun, but the game can be very difficult and frustrating to control.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-8c-Super-Mario-35.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8c-Super-Mario-35-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8c-Super-Mario-35-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8c-Super-Mario-35-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8c-Super-Mario-35-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8c-Super-Mario-35-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8c-Super-Mario-35-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>Super Mario Bros. 35 was a special anniversary game released for Mario's 35th Anniversary Celebration this year. It takes one of my favorite games, Super Mario Bros. 1, and makes a party game out of it by turning it into a battle royale in which you and 34 other players send enemies to each other to try to eliminate each other and be the last person standing. This was a very fun remix, and way better than Nintendo's last attempt at this format, Tetris 99.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-8d-Lego-Mario.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>Finally, a word about Lego Mario. Thanks to the next item on this list, I realized that Lego was something I was missing from my life. I picked up a couple of small sets to create a little interactive diorama of a very Super Mario Bros. 1-esque level, complete with nearly every major enemy from that game, plus a couple extras. Building, playing, and re-designing this level was a lot of fun; Nintendo really did a clever thing by making not just Lego sculptures, but little building kits that let you re-design levels as much as you like.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>9) Nintendo Labo</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>"Okay," I said to myself just a month or two before the pandemic began and lockdowns started happening. "I think it's about time for me to finally try this Labo thing." I already made a huge long Christmas post about every toy that's been released for the line so far. But regarding the kits themselves, I'll just say that I usually got more fun out of building these things than playing with them. It reminded me of growing up with Lego kits, and getting really excited about the instructions and how the kits were put together.<br><br>I guess the biggest downside is, now I have to find a place to store all this cardboard. But hey, for all the hours of fun I've gotten out of these things, super worth it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>10) TIE: Tetris Effect / Just Shapes &amp; Beats</strong></p>
<p>Here's two games that involved a lot of muscle memory and getting into the flow of things. They're also both beautifully designed.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-10a-Tetris-Effect.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10a-Tetris-Effect-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10a-Tetris-Effect-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10a-Tetris-Effect-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10a-Tetris-Effect-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10a-Tetris-Effect-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10a-Tetris-Effect-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1600" height="900"></figure>
<p>Tetris Effect is surprisingly difficult as a Tetris game. By the time you're just a few levels in, the Tetris blocks are coming in fast. But I don't really play this game to beat it. I play it to become enraptured once again by the insane audiovisual experience this game has to offer. I'm reminded of Thumper as a similar example of, like... just an insane amount of work that's been put into the music and visuals, not to alter the gameplay at all, but just to make the experience that much more powerful. No wonder both games work so well as VR experiences.</p>

<p>Just Shapes &amp; Beats is the kind of game that I play a few levels of, go away for a while, then come back and replay all the old levels and get just a little bit farther with a few new levels. It really functions as a playlist of old favorite tunes that I can come back to whenever I want. Still haven't finished it, but I really appreciated it this year, especially the level that manages to feel like a James Bond-esque heist despite being made of 2D geometric shapes.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>11) TIE: Splatoon 2 / Super Smash Bros. Ultimate / <br>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe / Arms</strong></p>
<p>These are the old favorite multiplayer-focused Nintendo games on Switch that I enjoyed returning to this year.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-11a-Splatoon-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11a-Splatoon-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11a-Splatoon-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11a-Splatoon-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11a-Splatoon-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11a-Splatoon-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11a-Splatoon-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>Once Nintendo announced that they were returning with the special monthly Splatfest events in Splatoon 2, I figured it was about time to get to work on the singleplayer campaign and DLC so that I could unlock the game's second playable character, the Octoling. I actually still haven't done so, but I'm over halfway there, and I have just a few more weeks until what could be the final Splatfest in January. This game just had a nice aesthetic to return to after a little bit of time away from it.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-11b-SSBU.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11b-SSBU-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11b-SSBU-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11b-SSBU-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11b-SSBU-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11b-SSBU-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11b-SSBU-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate continued to release new characters all throughout the year: Byleth from Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Min-Min from Arms, Steve and others from Minecraft, and Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII all joined the game. I'm extremely impressed by Sakurai and his team at Nintendo, who are continuing to actively support the game over two years into its release. Super Smash Bros. continues to be an event, and I enjoyed returning to this game and its single-player content all year.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-11cd-MK8-and-Arms.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11cd-MK8-and-Arms-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11cd-MK8-and-Arms-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11cd-MK8-and-Arms-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11cd-MK8-and-Arms-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11cd-MK8-and-Arms-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-11cd-MK8-and-Arms-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="2558" height="722"></figure>
<p>I don't have much insightful to say about Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or Arms. I started working on getting every gold star in the 150cc races in Mario Kart, and completing each Arms character's campaign on a level 4 difficulty to unlock their special art. I just really enjoyed spending time with these games this year, and thought they deserved to make the list.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>12) TIE: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity / Lego Marvel Superheroes / Minecraft</strong></p>
<p>These are all games I played with my partner this year; it was a nice way to spend time together.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-12a-Hyrule-Warriors-AOC.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12a-Hyrule-Warriors-AOC-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12a-Hyrule-Warriors-AOC-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12a-Hyrule-Warriors-AOC-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12a-Hyrule-Warriors-AOC-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12a-Hyrule-Warriors-AOC-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12a-Hyrule-Warriors-AOC-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is the only new game we played together this year. At only a few hours in, we're pretty impressed at the different movesets they've given the various playable characters. Some characters feel underpowered and some feel a bit overpowered, but we've both found favorites we keep returning to.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-12b-Lego-Marvel-Superheroes.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12b-Lego-Marvel-Superheroes-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12b-Lego-Marvel-Superheroes-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12b-Lego-Marvel-Superheroes-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12b-Lego-Marvel-Superheroes-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12b-Lego-Marvel-Superheroes-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12b-Lego-Marvel-Superheroes-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>Lego Marvel Superheroes was a nice way to explore the Marvel universe together, in a year when I was digging deep into it for the Marvel Project (the results of which are also being published on this blog). Despite being released before the push for diversity that really started in earnest around 2014, the cast of characters available in the game is pretty impressive.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-12c-Minecraft.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12c-Minecraft-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12c-Minecraft-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12c-Minecraft-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12c-Minecraft-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12c-Minecraft-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-12c-Minecraft-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>Finally, I had a good time in Minecraft this year, building a little house and farm together with my partner, who taught me how to play the game for the first time. And I was absolutely devastated when I accidentally erased the entire thing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>13) TIE: Picross S 1-3 / Ring Fit Adventure</strong></p>
<p>Position 13 is a shout-out to the games that got me thru 2020 with some semblance of physical and mental health. These games helped me at a time when I really needed them.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-13abc-Picross-S123.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13abc-Picross-S123-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13abc-Picross-S123-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13abc-Picross-S123-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13abc-Picross-S123-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13abc-Picross-S123-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13abc-Picross-S123-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="3832" height="720"></figure>
<p>I suffered from chronic anxiety and insomnia this year, and needed to find a game that I could play without having to really think about it, so I could take my mind off things. Picross was exactly the game I needed for that. It's a game that smartly teaches you how to play it, and slowly ramps up the difficulty curve to an impressive degree. I tore thru the first two games in the Switch series this year, and am already nearly halfway thru the third.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-13d-Ring-Fit-Adventure.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13d-Ring-Fit-Adventure-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13d-Ring-Fit-Adventure-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13d-Ring-Fit-Adventure-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13d-Ring-Fit-Adventure-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13d-Ring-Fit-Adventure-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-13d-Ring-Fit-Adventure-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>I was extremely lucky that my roommate acquired Ring Fit Adventure before they became very rare in the spring for obvious reasons. This is how my roommates and I attempted to stay somewhat physically healthy in a year where the three of us stayed mostly inside. It's a flawed game, but there's a good degree of customization that lets you personalize workouts however you want.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>14) Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-14-Clubhouse-Games.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-14-Clubhouse-Games-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-14-Clubhouse-Games-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-14-Clubhouse-Games-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-14-Clubhouse-Games-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-14-Clubhouse-Games-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-14-Clubhouse-Games-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>This was a nice little collection of games that Nintendo released partway thru the year. I had a lot of fun playing silly card games and board games with my roommates, with people across the country, and with myself. Easily the best minigame collection I've ever played.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>15) TIE: Overwatch / Borderlands / Alien: Isolation / Civilization VI</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-15-compilation.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-15-compilation-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-15-compilation-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-15-compilation-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-15-compilation-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-15-compilation-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-15-compilation-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="2554" height="1434"></figure>
<p>Finally, a shoutout to ports of recent games that I played with on Switch this year. Multiplayer shooter Overwatch, single-player or co-op shooter Borderlands, sci-fi horror stealth Alien Isolation, and 4X strategy Civilization VI all were comforting and familiar games to play with this year, and it was nice to be able to play those wherever I wanted, even in bed or under blankets. This was a year where I really valued games that gave me comfort.</p>

                <p>It's become a yearly tradition for me to put together a Best Of The Year list for the media I enjoyed in that year. And goodness knows, this is a year when a lot of us needed media to get thru the year. Movies, shows, videogames, and comics helped me get thru a really difficult time, and some of them have become my new favorites.</p>
<p>This is the second of three best of the year lists to be posted this week. For all three lists, any media is eligible, regardless of what year it came out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>1) She-Ra &amp; the Princesses of Power</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-1-She-Ra.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1366" height="768"></figure>
<p>My favorite show of all time, Steven Universe, finished up this year. And while that show was a shoe-in for my best show of 2019, it only made it to position 2 this year. Steven Universe in 2019 boasted the end of its regular show, the movie, and the beginning of its epilogue series, whereas Steven Universe in 2020 aired just a few episodes to conclude its run.<br><br>Meanwhile, She-Ra came along this year and absolutely knocked it out of the park. I remember when this show first aired at the end of 2018, and there were tons of moments when I couldn't believe what I was watching. I think I shouted aloud at least once per episode in She-Ra's first season. Because even if She-Ra's queerness isn't as explicit in season 1 as it would be later, the show is absolutely drenched in queer culture. The way characters interact with each other, their dialogue, their jokes, their struggles, the way they see the world, all of it is queer on a very deep level. Watching the first season of She-Ra was mindblowing, because I'd never really seen myself portrayed on TV like that before.<br><br>That was two years ago. Since then, She-Ra's middle seasons have gotten a bit stuck in the weeds of its own plotting. There's been some great moments, episodes, and characters, but nothing as amazing as that first season. Until now.<br><br>She-Ra's final season, which aired this year, was absolutely incredible. Plot developments came fast and frequently. Catra became an actual for-real protagonist just a few episodes in. Her new dynamic with Adora, Glimmer, and Bow was deeply cute. Entrapta, who's slowly solidifed her position as my favorite character over the show's runtime, got a LOT more screentime than last season, when she was pretty much absent.<br><br>Everybody's talking about the kiss in the final episode. It's all over the internet. And yeah, when that happened, I breathed a huge sigh of relief that showrunner Noelle Stevenson actually made it to the finish line on that one. But even before that, I knew that She-Ra had done something special.<br><br>Maybe its middle seasons were a compromised vision, or maybe the writers had a great beginning and ending planned but couldn't find enough interesting stuff to do in the middle. It doesn't matter. What She-Ra brought to the screen stole my heart. I have so much love for its characters, its world, and its unabashed queerness. This show was special.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>2) Steven Universe Future</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1280" height="720"></figure>
<p>I truly cannot say how special it was that two of my favorite shows, both very queer LGBT cartoons that concluded this year, had nonbinary creators and showrunners. Both of them came out as nonbinary very recently, and it really means a lot that these very visible creators are helping to normalize nonbinary genders.<br><br>So, Steven Universe Future. Only ten episodes aired this year to finish off the journey, but whoof, they were big episodes. This year, Future finally delivered on its promise to follow up on the emotional consequences of the show's events on Steven. He turned into a massive kaiju, got a big climactic hug, then got therapy and found a way forward in his life. Certainly the LGBT community needs to hear that message of hope, and the importance of self-care and leaning on others when you need to, but it's a pretty relatable message for everyone, I think.<br><br>I'm going to miss these characters. Everyone from Steven to Smoky Quartz. But it's also the most fitting ending they could have given them. Sometimes you don't know what happens next, and that's okay. What a thing of beauty the Crewniverse has put out into the world with this show.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>3) The Haunting of Hill House</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1080" height="524"></figure>
<p>I think the highest praise I can give this show is that it had me jumping at shadows for weeks. I had to sleep with the light on until long after we finished it.<br><br>So, first of all: The Haunting of Hill House is a deeply emotional story about family trauma and reconciliation. It has a fascinatingly unusual structure: the events of the story only really take place over a couple of days, and the majority is told in flashback. Every character is put thru the wringer, but this does help each of them to finally understand how the trauma of Hill House affected them, and how to move forward from that.<br><br>The show's cleverest trick, however, is in its easter eggs. At some point while watching the show, viewers will probably start to notice ghosts hiding in the background of shots. No attention is called to them, and they aren't all that relevant to the plot. They're just there, mostly as a way to illustrate how haunted Hill House is. Over time, the background ghosts become so obviously placed that they're impossible to ignore, and you'll spend the rest of the series keeping an eye out for them. I knew about the hidden ghosts going into the series, so I was on the lookout from episode one.<br><br>Last year, I watched a horror movie called It Follows, about a monster that possesses people and constantly, slowly walks towards its victims. This makes the main characters paranoid, as they keep an eye out for anybody walking slowly towards them, but it also makes the viewer paranoid as they watch in the background of shots for any potential suspects. Hill House has exactly the same effect. It makes you paranoid, it makes you look for figures even when there are only shadows. It's the kind of mental conditioning that followed me back into the real world. It was, well, haunting.<br><br>But I wouldn't put a show that traumatized me this high if that trick was all it had up its sleeve. Hill House is filled with good storytelling choices from start to finish. It's pretty hard to watch at times, and I had to force myself to watch episodes that I knew would be on the gorier side, but it was absolutely worth it, and it's a story that'll stick with me for years.</p>

<p>Princess Principal is an anime about a group of teenage super-spies in a war-torn and poverty-ravaged Victorian London, from the studio that made the ultra-gay series Flip Flappers. It is *exactly* my shit.<br><br>This one's pretty conceptually simple. Each of the girls has some special ability, each has a tragic background that brought them into their spy group. There's some echoes of Prince and the Pauper with the two leads, who were childhood friends and have found each other again after a long absence as the show's story begins.<br><br>It's presented out of chronological order, but the show is so episodic that it doesn't really matter; each episode is fairly self-contained. The plot almost never matters except as a vehicle to show some cool spy stuff, and mostly to deepen our understanding of the characters and their relationships with each other. Of course there's a train heist, of course there's a daring climax full of twists and double-crosses. All the essentials are here.<br><br>Listen, I'll be honest: spies aren't usually my genre, so this wasn't necessarily going to be a slam-dunk. The thing is, this series is presented as more of a heist show, given the self-contained nature of each mission, and heist shows *are* my genre. But it's more than that. This show has a deep, rich, and yes, very queer heart. The characters stuck with me, and I'll be thinking about this for a while - especially since there's a series of movie sequels planned, which will hopefully begin to wrap up the plot that the studio couldn't quite find a satisfying conclusion to in the show. Not that it matters; the girls have each other, and that's enough.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>5) The Mandalorian</strong></p>

<p>I probably should have guessed that a show from these creators would be good. Jon Favreau wrote and directed some knockout stories with visual spectacle over the last couple decades, including Iron Man and Zathura. Dave Filoni, meanwhile, cut his teeth working on Avatar: The Last Airbender, and then moved on to be an executive producer on recent animated Star Wars shows The Clone Wars and Rebels.<br><br>But I didn't guess it would be this good. The thing is, The Mandalorian is very basic. Its main two characters (The Mandalorian and The Child) don't even have names for the vast majority of its first season. That first season isn't all that interested in telling a serialized story, and is more interested in telling self-contained stories about their adventures.<br><br>The storytelling in a lot of the first season's episodes are simple, and yet visually rich and subtle, that it feels like an animated show that's been made in live-action. The Mandalorian is a very likable protagonist, and his supporting cast is similarly fun. It's also really cool to me that Mandalorian was a pioneer of TV &amp; film visual effects all on its own. After being burned by Star Wars Episode IX late last year, I was pleasantly surprised to find this show was a much more welcome Star Wars experience.<br><br>I haven't seen the second season yet, although I've been spoiled to heck about it. That's lowered my expectations for the second season quite a bit; the first season had almost no fanfare to it, and was merely a really well-told story.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I rewatched Little Witch Academia, Trigger's show about a school for witches that aired a couple of years ago. I didn't put it on this list because I've watched it in its entirety before, but this did remind me that, yes, Little Witch Academia is still one of my favorite shows of all time. Just deeply good from start to finish.<br><br>BNA: Brand New Animal, Trigger's follow-up to Little Witch, is substantially less good. If Little Witch was "let's make an anime out of Harry Potter," Brand New Animal is "let's make an anime out of Zootopia." But Little Witch tweaked a lot of elements, clarified some themes, and brought a strong cast of characters to the table. Brand New Animal doesn't really do any of those things.<br><br>Why so high on the list? Well, it's got a shapeshifting tanuki protagonist and a surprising undercurrent of queerness in places, so it's basically my kryptonite. The first two-thirds of the show has a lot of fun concepts for its episodes. The baseball episode went viral immediately, but I related hard to the episode where Michiru made a dolphin friend and went to a human party to pretend to be human together for a night. It just hit at some deeper emotions than I expected.<br><br>I like Michiru's childhood friend-turned-rival, I like the music, I LOVE the visual aesthetic (which is darker and cooler than Little Witch, despite having the same director), and I adore all the transformations. The ending of this show really lets it down, but if you adapt Zootopia without really changing anything, that's gonna happen. BNA is a good reminder that the prey-animals-as-racism-allegory thing really really really wasn't a good idea.<br><br>Honestly, this probably shouldn't be as high as it is, from a more objective critical standpoint. I just liked it a lot, so it gets extra points.</p>

<p>This was the year I finally buckled down and watched some of the great live-action comedies of the last few years, which landed at positions 7 and 8 on my list. After dabbling in the series before, and rewatching the Yahtzee episode about half a dozen times, I finally sat down and pretty much binged Community seasons 1-3 in just a few weeks. I tried season 4, I tried hard, but I just couldn't get thru it. Never mind; season 3 gives the show a really excellent ending anyway.<br><br>Community's kind of known for its genre pastiches. The zombie episode, the documentary episodes, the one where they go to space, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons episode, and of course the paintball wars. There's a Halloween special all three years, there's a stop-motion animated Christmas episode, there's a whole lot of jokes about Glee. And yeah, experiencing a lot of this for the first time was very cool. By midway thru season 2, you don't know what you're gonna get when you turn on a Community episode, and that's fun as heck.<br><br>I think what really hooked me on the show was Abed. Because it turns out, a lot of the genre pastiches aren't there just for the fun of it, but because Abed sees the world differently from everybody - as a story, an adventure, a TV episode. The more the study group bonds together, the more they all start to see it too. Community's cast is the most self-aware about their own narratives of any set of characters I've ever encountered. "I'm doing a bottle episode!"<br><br>Community is a show about the powers of story and love, and how those two interact with each other. In 2020, that was a story I needed to hear.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>8) The Good Place</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-8-The-Good-Place.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure>
<p>I've watched The Good Place in very small chunks. I saw the first season when it came to Netflix, once the whole season had aired and I'd heard that this was a show worth watching. Early in 2020, I sat down to watch the second season, enjoyed it, and then dropped off again. I almost didn't come back.<br><br>What brought me back to finish the show was The Good Place in even smaller chunks. NBC has been aggressive about putting 3-4 minute segments of the show on Youtube, clips that stand on their own and establish some funny bit of worldbuilding, or that just tell a good joke or share a heartwarming moment. I got a sense of the show's second half in small bits, until finally I relented and finished the whole thing.<br><br>Long before I finished, my roommates and I quoted and referenced the show's mythology verbatim to each other on a regular basis. Things like the Time Knife and Jeremy Bearimy are now common parlance in my household.<br><br>I bring this all up to establish the strength of this show's worldbuilding. Oh, it's coming from a very specific worldview; as my partner pointed out, it's about a group of liberals who rationally argue their way to a better afterlife system. But the world is very fleshed out, if only for comedy purposes, and many of the little details they've come up with are clever and funny.<br><br>As with all of my favorite shows this year, tho, The Good Place wouldn't work half as well without a strong cast of characters. I love Michael and Janet's haphazard attempts at understanding humanity, and I love the earnestness mixed with anxiety that defines Chidi and Eleanor's deep love of each other. When Chidi came to the realization late in the show that The Good Place wasn't really a place, but was just time to spend with your loved ones, I cried. Chidi and Eleanor have a relationship that's good at making me cry.<br><br>This was a rough, rough year. And one of the things that I found the hardest was being reminded of my own mortality and impermanence as the pandemic has continued. And ultimately, amidst all the laughs, The Good Place grapples with death in a sweet and heartfelt way, and it believes in the inherent goodness of humanity.</p>

<p>I watched a fair bit of reality television this year, from The Amazing Race to The Bachelor. Especially over the summer, I needed some low-effort television to pass the time. Zumbo's Just Desserts surprised me the most with how fun and engaging it was.<br><br>Just Desserts is a dessert-making competition set inside what appears to be a lab from Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, hosted by dessert wizard Zumbo. Each episode is divided into two parts. In the first half, contestants are challenged to create a dessert inspired by a simple prompt, like "hot and cold" or "magical" or "kid's birthday." In the second half, the two lowest-scoring contestants go one-on-one in a competition to duplicate a dessert designed and crafted by Zumbo himself. This dessert usually has some strange or difficult twist, around a dozen separate components, and intricate detailing. I was particularly fond of an ice cream cone that had all the layers of nachos inside it, and a chocolate hat that melted to nothing under hot liquid.<br><br>As with other reality shows, it's cool to see the contestants' journey over time, and how they change and hone their skills. But more than other reality shows, Zumbo has a gee-whiz "how did they do that?" factor that kept me addictively coming back for more. I'm extremely hopeful that once the pandemic lifts, Netflix renews this show for another tasty season.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>10) Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1157" height="608"></figure>
<p>There were a lot of great opening title sequences in shows I watched this year. Just to name a few, Princess Principal, Brand New Animal, and The Haunting of Hill House all have impressive animated openings with great songs. But Eizouken brought Japanese hip-hop to the party, and easily had the best title sequence of any show I watched this year. I was humming "Easy Breezy" as soon as I learned of this show's existence.<br><br>The Japanese title for "Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken" translates more literally to "Don't Mess With The Film Club." It follows three high school girls (the story girl, the animator, and the business one) as they realize their dream of making anime. And despite the significant challenges of making anime on a high school budget while also attending classes, they manage to pull it off, establishing their presence as a formidable one - hence the title.<br><br>Eizouken has been called a love letter to a lot of things - anime both general and specific, stories in general, the power of imagination. At least once an episode, the imaginary world intrudes on the real one, and we see the characters not merely designing their creations on paper, but experiencing them on a life-size scale, letting them tinker with their machines like mechanics, and go on wild adventures. The story stays focused on their production of the anime, but the little asides illustrate how these three see the world around them.<br><br>And I appreciated that. It's pretty close to how I interact with the world, where every little thing is potential fuel for a story, or at least for me to imagine what it might be like to live in a place that's a little more fantastical.</p>

<p>Four years ago, Your Name supplanted my previous favorite film of all time, Spirited Away. It was a sweet and touching, albeit slightly melodramatic, love story involving a lot of body-swapping in the first half. I saw it right when I needed to, as I was figuring out my gender. Makoto Shinkai's follow-up film, released this year, had a lot to live up to.<br><br>I'm shocked to find that Weathering With You is already vying for the top slot as my favorite film of all time, despite having only been released this year. It's also a love story set in a slightly magical Japan, but a lot of what Shinkai was trying to do with Your Name has been tightened up here. While Your Name kluged together a few different plot devices to tell its tale, including body swapping and time travel, Weathering With You tells a much more cohesive story about personal responsibility and love in a time of crisis. My friends found its ending divisive; I found it uplifting. I saw this film in January, but I've been thinking about it ever since, all year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>2) TIE: The Lego Batman Movie / The Lego Ninjago Movie / <br></strong><strong>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part</strong></p>
<p>I saw The Lego Movie in theaters in 2014, but only this year did I finally get around to seeing the other three films in Warner Bros.' attempt at a Lego cinematic universe. I'm honestly quite impressed, and a bit disappointed in myself for not supporting the movies in theaters when I had the chance.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/Movie-2a-The-Lego-Batman-Movie.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2a-The-Lego-Batman-Movie-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2a-The-Lego-Batman-Movie-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2a-The-Lego-Batman-Movie-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2a-The-Lego-Batman-Movie-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2a-The-Lego-Batman-Movie-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2a-The-Lego-Batman-Movie-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1279" height="532"></figure>
<p>The Lego Batman Movie is my least favorite of the three, but it's as solid of a Batman movie as you can get. I tend to prefer Batman stories that cast a wide focus on the entire Bat-family, and this does that, with an absolutely silly enormous cast of villain characters too.</p>

<p>The Lego Ninjago Movie feels a lot like Power Rangers, which I also watched a lot of this year. It's not very original, but it's solid action and quite a lot of fun, and I found myself quite endeared to its characters and world.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/Movie-2c-The-Lego-Movie-2.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2c-The-Lego-Movie-2-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2c-The-Lego-Movie-2-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2c-The-Lego-Movie-2-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2c-The-Lego-Movie-2-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2c-The-Lego-Movie-2-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-2c-The-Lego-Movie-2-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1699" height="670"></figure>
<p>The Lego Movie 2 caps off the series with my favorite entry to date. It's imaginative, it's sweet, it deepens the characters from the original movie, and it's got a ton of great new characters and songs.  ("This song's gonna get stuck inside your head!!") It doesn't hurt that this movie features the most prominent female characters in the series, including quite a lot of screentime for Wyldstyle. Of all the movies, this is the one that I'm gonna be seeking out Lego sets for in the future.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>3) Clue</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/Movie-3-Clue.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-3-Clue-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-3-Clue-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-3-Clue-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-3-Clue-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-3-Clue-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-3-Clue-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="982" height="562"></figure>
<p>First of two items on this list that I call "how had I not seen this yet?" I've been trying to see this movie for years, and now I've finally gotten around to it.<br><br>There are just so many incredible moments in Clue. ("If there's anyone in here... just look out!") My roommates have been quoting it continuously for ages, and now I can join in. Every actor is having far, far too much fun. ("Flames... on the side of my face.") This was also just a great follow-up to my favorite movie of 2019, Knives Out, another mansion murder mystery, which even stole one of Clue's jokes outright.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>4) Die Hard</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/Movie-4-Die-Hard.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-4-Die-Hard-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-4-Die-Hard-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-4-Die-Hard-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-4-Die-Hard-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-4-Die-Hard-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-4-Die-Hard-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="1271" height="541"></figure>
<p>So clearly, Die Hard is an action movie standard for a reason. As I was watching this, I kept thinking of Raiders of the Lost Ark, a movie in which pretty much every single action scene has become iconic. Alan Rickman plays the most deeply fun villain of just about any movie or show I've ever seen, and Bruce Willis is really good in it too.<br><br>It's also a Christmas movie, since that's the main discourse that comes up with this movie now. This movie really wants to remind you every other scene that it's Christmas, and its hero even has a very Christmas-esque change of heart. Overall, I was extremely surprised how well this held up.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>5) 1917</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/Movie-5-1917.PNG" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-2xl.PNG 1600w"  alt="" width="872" height="378"></figure>
<p>Well, I only saw two movies in theaters this year, so it's a good thing both of them were good. 1917 feels as much like a very well-produced video game as it does a movie, but at least it's a fun video game, where something interesting is happening most of the time.<br><br>The "we did this all in one shot" gag is so obviously constructed that it's hard to ignore that aspect while watching. In contrast, Birdman from 2014 has very very long sequences where it's difficult to tell if there was a cut, and the performers just had to memorize huge pieces of dialogue and just go for it. There was an innate tension in Birdman because I just couldn't believe that the camera was still rolling. 1917 feels very artificial in comparison.<br><br>And yet... well, it has some really standout performances that raise this movie above its gag. It's thinly written, but moments from the film still haunt me, and that's exactly what a World War I movie should do. "I had hoped today would be a good day," says one character. Big 2020 mood, y'all.</p>

<p>Nintendo Labo is a new project by Nintendo to bring cardboard toys into kids' houses. The toys come as flat sheets of cardboard, and after some bending and folding, are made into cardboard gizmos that are powered by the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>It is... extremely fun. There is just a ton of creativity in the toy designs, they're relatively easy to build, and the design of the game and education aspects of the toys are pretty good too.<br><br>Over the course of the year, I've acquired all four Labo kits and built every toycon. The quality of the toycon does range a fair bit, so as a holiday treat, here's a ranking of every single toycon.</p>

<p>A little gadget that attaches to the Car wheel and lets you play the Vehicle Kit game off the big screen. Unfortunately, it doesn't attach to the other two Vehicle Kit toycon, so you can't change to the other two gadgets in the game. Switching between the three is a main feature of the game and required for exploration, so I don't really see the point. <strong>D-</strong></p>

<p>A really simple box build. It's cute to look at and looks great in trailers. In practice, I find there's not actually all that much that's interesting to do with the little critter inside the house. More of a nifty little gizmo than a real toy or game, and it takes up a bit too much space. <strong>C+</strong></p>

<p>The Key is an extremely basic build that then gets inserted into the other Vehicle Kit toycon. I think in concept it's very good. It is a little bit flimsy. <strong>B-</strong></p>

<p>A cute little toycon that gives you a very basic idea of the Toycon functionality. Attach the Switch joycon to the sides, and their vibration will allow you to drive it like a vehicle. It doesn't work great, but the idea is very playful. <strong>B-</strong></p>

<p>I love the tactile nature of this gadget, how the wheels on the side make satisfying "tic-tic-tic" noises as you turn them. But it's extremely difficult to control in the game, and I find myself using the sub least of the three vehicles. <strong>B-</strong></p>

<p>All three of the vehicles in the Vehicle Kit must be powered by this pedal. This works totally fine. I actually think that despite its small size, it's surprisingly versatile. <strong>B</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>13) Wind Pedal</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Wind-Pedal-with-Joycon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Wind-Pedal-with-Joycon-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Wind-Pedal-with-Joycon-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Wind-Pedal-with-Joycon-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Wind-Pedal-with-Joycon-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Wind-Pedal-with-Joycon-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Wind-Pedal-with-Joycon-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>In concept, a lot of this build is identical to the Pedal from the Vehicle Kit. It's quite a bit larger than the Pedal, and getting air blown in your face while you leap around in VR is quite immersive. The frog jumping game it comes with just isn't all that fun for me, tho. <strong>B</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>12) Robot</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Robot-with-Joycon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Robot-with-Joycon-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Robot-with-Joycon-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Robot-with-Joycon-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Robot-with-Joycon-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Robot-with-Joycon-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Robot-with-Joycon-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>Extremely complex build. Probably the most complex of any single toycon. However, I don't actually like the game all that much; it's a little basic. As for the toy itself, there's some nifty features, but I don't know, all the little strings makes it actually feels surprisingly flimsy for how bulky it is, and I don't like pulling it out very much. Still, points for an extremely impressive build. <strong>B</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>11) Elephant</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Elephant-with-Joycon-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Elephant-with-Joycon-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Elephant-with-Joycon-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Elephant-with-Joycon-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Elephant-with-Joycon-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Elephant-with-Joycon-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Elephant-with-Joycon-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>This pairs with the VR Goggles to let you play games and draw art in a 3D space. I like the build, I like the idea, it's honestly really fun to play around with. I do think that the build is a little haphazard and the toy doesn't feel as good as it could. <strong>B</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>10) Screen Holder</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Screen-Holder-with-Switch-Not-Blurry.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Holder-with-Switch-Not-Blurry-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Holder-with-Switch-Not-Blurry-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Holder-with-Switch-Not-Blurry-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Holder-with-Switch-Not-Blurry-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Holder-with-Switch-Not-Blurry-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Screen-Holder-with-Switch-Not-Blurry-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>This is a tiny little gadget that lets you play any of the VR games off a screen rather than having to look in VR, and I want to give Nintendo huge points for providing this as a much-needed accessibility feature. <strong>B+</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>9) Motorbike</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Motorbike-with-Joycon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Motorbike-with-Joycon-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Motorbike-with-Joycon-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Motorbike-with-Joycon-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Motorbike-with-Joycon-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Motorbike-with-Joycon-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Motorbike-with-Joycon-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>It took me a little while to figure out how this actually works, but it's essentially just a racing game. It's really fun to play with, albeit a bit flimsy in some areas and maybe not all that challenging. I do love that it's compatible with Mario Kart. <strong>B+</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>8) Camera</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Camera-with-Joycon-with-Goggles.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Camera-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Camera-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Camera-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Camera-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Camera-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Camera-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>Just tactile enough to feel pretty real. The provided game is honestly really fun. It feels decently easy to control, and it's fun to play with, despite how relatively easy the build is. <strong>B+</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>7) Plane</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Plane-with-Key-with-Joycon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Plane-with-Key-with-Joycon-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Plane-with-Key-with-Joycon-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Plane-with-Key-with-Joycon-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Plane-with-Key-with-Joycon-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Plane-with-Key-with-Joycon-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Plane-with-Key-with-Joycon-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>A very basic gadget that nevertheless has a couple of clever build features and that provides some of the most fun play in the Vehicle Kit. <strong>A-</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6) Fishing Rod</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Fishing-Rod-with-Joycon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Fishing-Rod-with-Joycon-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Fishing-Rod-with-Joycon-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Fishing-Rod-with-Joycon-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Fishing-Rod-with-Joycon-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Fishing-Rod-with-Joycon-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Fishing-Rod-with-Joycon-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>This one's extremely clever in how it implements various tactile functions in the gadget. A decently fun little fishing game, too. For me it gets old sooner than I'd like, but this is quite creative, and one of the more fun actual games in the Variety Kit. <strong>A-</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5) Blaster</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Blaster-with-Joycon-with-Goggles.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Blaster-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Blaster-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Blaster-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Blaster-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Blaster-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Blaster-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>The most complex build in the VR Kit. It looks very impressive, and the way it uses haptic feedback is pretty clever. Probably the best part of the blaster is the shooting game is the most visually impressive of the Kit. It's also just one of the neatest looking toys you can build. <strong>A</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4) Bird</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Bird-with-Joycon-with-Goggles.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Bird-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Bird-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Bird-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Bird-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Bird-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Bird-with-Joycon-with-Goggles-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>This is... just extremely deeply cool. First of all, the build has some odd angles that don't seem like they should be physically possible with cardboard. Second, the toy is compatible with two other toycon (the Pinwheel and the Wind Pedal) to improve the experience. Third, the wings are cleverly designed to give you a blast of air while you're playing. But best of all, this lets you play the coolest game in the VR Kit, an open-world exploration that lets you fly around an island in VR. It's easily one of the most fun experiences in a standout kit. <strong>A</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3) Piano</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Piano-with-Joycon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>I haven't actually played with this very much. I don't think it has much staying power as a toy. It does have a decently robust music creation suite, but it's a little too much for me to figure out.<br><br>However, it's easily my favorite *looking* toycon, it is one of the most impressive in features, and I keep it out on display constantly. For every feature except the play, this gets very high marks. <strong>A</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2) Car</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Car-with-Joycon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Car-with-Joycon-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Car-with-Joycon-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Car-with-Joycon-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Car-with-Joycon-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Car-with-Joycon-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Car-with-Joycon-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>This balances functionality, play, and impressiveness of build in a big way. It has a huge number of features, maybe more than any other individual toycon, and it's easy to pop the lid off the thing and look at them. It's also the most versatile to play with in the Vehicle Kit open world map. (Just generally speaking, I adore the little exploration game that comes with Vehicle Kit.) This is one of the best. <strong>A+</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1) VR Goggles</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure>
<p>I'm surprised how well this works. Legitimately. I'm also surprised just how much there is to do with this gadget, both by itself and with the other gadgets in the kit. This kit feels like they put the most work into providing games for you to do, and every one of them uses the VR goggles. Plus this gadget is usable in at least four other Nintendo-published games. <strong>A+</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>And that's it! That's the whole set. I will say, this was a nice way to pass the time this year. I'd recommend these if you have a Switch and don't mind building a little bit.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering which Kit to get, here's my thoughts on the four.</p>
<p><strong>Robot Kit</strong> has a very complex build and a pretty simple game. Do not start here.</p>
<p><strong>Variety Kit</strong> is a nice introduction to the Labo kits, with low replay value but some neat gadgets.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle Kit</strong> has one single game and just a few larger gadgets that they've put a lot of effort into. I'm not sure how well it works as a starting point, but it's a solid set overall.</p>
<p><strong>VR Kit</strong> has a gentle learning curve, some of the neatest builds of the bunch, a huge amount of replay value with the included games, and compatibility with several other Nintendo-published Switch games. It's my favorite set of the four.</p>
<p>Happy building!</p>

<p>Some of my favorite characters ended up in Excalibur, including Kitty Pryde, Nightcrawler, and Rahne Sinclair. They're mixed in with some characters that I find to be extremely bland, like Pete Wisdom and Brian Braddock. Sorta along the same lines, Excalibur as a title is a bit of a mixed bag, but I ultimately have quite a lot of affection for it.<br><br>Excalibur is a spin-off X-book that's mostly unaffected by the X-Men crossover events by virtue of it taking place in Great Britain. As a result, it's almost totally based in old-school superhero soap opera drama; there's a lot of focus on who's dating who. There's some shitty boys in this series - what Kitty and Rahne see in Pete and Deadlock is totally beyond me - but I like a lot of the girl characters, and I like the unabashed fun of the action setpieces, from a malfunctioning pirate simulation to a series of living nightmares. This shit is my kryptonite.</p>

<p>Five titles are officially associated with the Heroes Return relaunch / re-branding. The first is Avengers; the next three are solo books of the core Avengers members: Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor. The final Heroes Return title is Fantastic Four. It's the only title to change its entire creative team within the first few issues, which isn't a good sign.<br><br>After only three issues, writer Scott Lobdell is joined by Chris Claremont as a co-writer. By issue six, Scott's off the book and Chris is sole writer. I don't know if Marvel wasn't happy with Lobdell's direction, or if Lobdell had too many other projects and bowed out so Chris could give the book the attention it deserved. <br><br>Lobdell's issues have a particular interest in focusing on a single member of the Fantastic Four in each issue. Even the annual, released during Lobdell's tenure but written by Karl Kesel, is a one-shot mostly focused on the Thing. By contrast, Claremont's issues focus on the team coming together as a family and fighting off supervillains as a group. Neither approach is necessarily better, but it's an interesting contrast. <br><br>So far I haven't really found all that much to love about the title. The standout so far is that Kesel-penned annual, in which the Thing finds himself in an alternate reality where all the main Marvel superheroes have grown old. It's an engaging take on superheroes that's pretty uncommon. I've seen post-apocalyptic versions of Marvel superheroes elsewhere, like in the late 2000s epic Old Man Logan, but the FF annual just kinda shows them aging out of their roles in a very realistically human way. It's touching, and the only issue of the run so far that's really stuck with me.</p>

<p>Nick Fury's been missing in the Marvel Comics continuity for some time now (he does that semi-frequently over the years), and this two-parter uses Agent 13 as a focal point to tell the story of how he gets back to the main Marvel Universe. It's a decently fun little event series, and I really hope both of these characters show up in the near future again.</p>

<p>I was really excited for this one. Young superheroes are one of my favorite sub-genres, because the superhero genre is just so tailor-made to work well as a coming-of-age story for kids and teens. The X-Men have a reason built into their very premise to have a strong youth focus - I mean, their main homebase is a school - so I had high hopes for a title specifically focusing on the X-kids, especially one with Emma Frost and Jubilee in lead roles.<br><br>A few of the issues perfectly capture some of the jubilance and fun of being a kid with superpowers. The first issue I read is a DeFalco-penned story about Gen X foiling the Circus of Crime, famously a supervillain group that's about as intimidating as a bag of chips. There's a storyline of Gen X dealing with a kid who steals their things, and another one where they watch a scary movie and Jubilee has nightmares afterwards. Perfect.<br><br>Smack dab in the middle of all this is a long multi-part story about the kids hopping into a surreal fantasy land where nothing makes sense. Nothing about this is explained properly, so rather than being a fun romp, it's a tedious chore to read, and it goes on for ages. There's some cool stuff with a couple kids merging together to become a stronger superhero, but it gets lost in the noise. Too bad.</p>

<p>For some reason, Marvel gave an unusual underground artist the reins to make a zine-like black-and-white one-shot of short stories about the Gen X team. They range in quality, but the unusual presentation and art style are super fun.</p>

<p>I had low expectations for this one, because none of the main cast of Heroes For Hire are among my favorite characters. Iron Fist and Hercules have kinda cool runs I read a bit of in the mid 2000s, but that's really it. Fascinatingly, Heroes For Hire ends up being one of the most fun romps of the year so far.<br><br>While Busiek's Avengers has had a pretty stable roster thus far, the Heroes (as penned by John Ostrander) have a roster that switches up something like every couple of issues. There's a LOT of characters coming from unusual places in the Marvel Universe - Scott Lang, She-Hulk, Black Knight, the Thunderbolts, the Punisher, and a new White Tiger all have prominent roles.<br><br>On top of that, the book's absolutely packed with plot. Since the Heroes For Hire are mercenaries, every character has their own agenda, and a lot of those agendas become significant sideplots. The book is never ever boring. Even the one-shot issues are fun: the latest one has Black Knight fighting a dragon in disguise as a Wall Street executive. Neat!<br><br>I'd say the book's one big misstep is how it handles Luke Cage. Early on in the series he's shown to be in league with the "Master of the World" (um, yuck??), a supervillain who's trying to depopulate the world. It's just all kinds of gross.</p>

<p>Here's the very end of Peter David's long, 100+ issue run on the title. Hulk doesn't reboot immediately for the Heroes Return event, but Bruce's return from that event's pocket universe does kick off a new storyline where Banner and Hulk try to work together again. There's a lot about the run that's super heartwarming - Thunderbolt Ross decides to try being nice to Hulk, Bruce works with Reed Richards to help Rick Jones learn to walk again, and Bruce/Hulk's marriage with Betty Ross flourishes.<br><br>Then, abruptly, in Peter David's penultimate issue, Betty dies from radiation overexposure. It's extremely sudden, devastating to the characters, and a *huge* mood whiplash. This is the last thing that Peter David leaves the new writers to deal with, because his final issue depicts an alternate future in which Hulk and the others come to terms with Betty's death. <br><br>I have to give Peter David some credit for finding a way to end his run, more or less definitively, on his own terms; you could really call this issue "the end of the Hulk's story" if you really wanted to. But since it's an alternate future, this still leaves a way out for the new writers to continue Hulk's story in the present day, and even bring Betty back to life later if they want to. Still, I wish Peter David had left himself more room to let the characters really struggle with this death, instead of merely making it a shock twist at the end of his run.</p>

<p>Namor's presence in Marvel Comics in 1998 is stronger than average - see Marvel Team-Up and Marvel Universe below for more on that. I really like Namor as a character - he's a grumpy little shit, but also has a strong moral compass and is fiercely protective of his family and his home. I love him.<br><br>This team-up continues Namor's story from Marvel Team-Up. Hulk is more of a guest-star, and is dealing with the immediate fallout of Betty's death in his own series. I kind of liked seeing these two damaged souls helping each other out, even if neither really did that much to directly address their own or each other's pain. </p>

<p>Like I said before, Iron Fist isn't really one of my favorite characters, and this miniseries is an incredibly basic take on him. The plot's a bit confusing too. We'll see if the wrap-up is any good, but... so far I'm not a fan.</p>

<p>At his most basic, Iron Man is a guy who enjoys being a rich playboy way more than Bruce Wayne does, and often fights supervillains who are annoyed at Tony's company for one reason or another. That's more or less what we saw with the Iron Man movies, and it's also pretty much what we get here. <br><br>Now don't get me wrong: "incredibly basic Iron Man" is still reasonably entertaining, particularly the two-parter where Tony deals with a supervillain while trying to rescue an island town from an active volcano. I *liked* the Iron Man movies, and I had fun with this. But I don't know, this is Kurt Busiek on writing duties, and after Avengers and Thunderbolts I kind of expect more from him. He's not the only good writer I've seen stumble with Iron Man, either; and it's not bad writing, he just doesn't really have anything interesting to say with the character.</p>

<p>This is the first of a two-parter miniseries depicting Tony's early life as Iron Man, and how he first learned to balance his life inside and outside the suit, as narrated by Pepper Potts. Busiek makes the story feel epic, and lends it a fair bit of detail. I kind of wish Pepper had more to do, tho.</p>

<p>After Thor vanished into a pocket universe for the Heroes Reborn event, his series was rebranded to its original title, Journey Into Mystery, from when it was a pulp adventure series in the 1950s and early 1960s. While Thor's gone, Journey Into Mystery becomes a vehicle for short features about other characters who don't have their own series. These 1998 issues feature Black Widow in a three-parter, and vampire detective Hannibal King in a two-parter.<br><br>The Black Widow story, penned by Scott Lobdell, is really freaking good! An old woman tells a government agent about how Black Widow fought a group of neo-Nazi revolutionaries, and he slowly comes to realize that she's an unreliable narrator. It's got some great twists and turns, and it's the most fun I've ever had with Black Widow as a character. Strong stuff, and again, better than I've come to expect from Scott Lobdell.<br><br>The story about the vampire detective is *so* boring by comparison. Hannibal King isn't a memorable or likeable character, he's not very heroic, and I didn't like how he treated the female characters.</p>

<p>"There is no way in hellfire they'll be able to make a *Ka-Zar* ongoing series interesting," I thought to myself. Well, for some reason, Marvel put Mark Waid on the first fourteen issues, Christopher Priest on the next batch, and Brian K. Vaughan on the annual, and those are three names you don't fuck around with in the comics industry. So, as a natural result, Ka-Zar is surprisingly good.<br><br>I don't find anything particularly interesting about the premise, which is basically that Ka-Zar, a caveman-like superhero, lives with his wife Shanna the She-Devil in the Savage Land. (Lotta superheroes are married in the late 90s - Hulk and Betty, Peter and Mary Jane, Cyclops and Jean Grey... it's a whole thing.) Ka-Zar's a fun guest star, but in his own book?<br><br>After a fakeout where Ka-Zar's own brother is the villain for the first few issues, Mark Waid throws fucking Thanos into the mix, calling the shots and attempting to escape his cosmic prison. In the climax of that storyline, Thanos turns New York City into a jungle, and Ka-Zar must race to save his family and homeland before it's overtaken by the surrounding Antarctic tundra. It's a lot of fun.<br><br>Then Christopher Priest sends Ka-Zar back to NYC and gives him a language impediment, where he can't understand anybody in NYC for mysterious reasons. He also throws the Punisher at him. It's a tonal shift from Waid's run, but it's just as fun.<br><br>I think Ka-Zar's and Shanna's relationship is... not great. She gets mad at him for having the hobby of playing with tech from the modern world, like Gameboys and radios, because she's worried that their presence in the Savage Land will hurt their child. I think it's an unreasonable overreaction that taints my view of their relationship for the rest of the run. But that's the strongest critique I have of an overall solid series.</p>

<p>The writers of the Cable annual had a story long enough to fit into two issues, and with good reason - this is the comeuppance of a major villain from the X-Men's most recent event, "Operation Zero Tolerance." This displays a unique benefit of the way Marvel structures its 1998 annuals: even tho there's no Machine Man series to write an annual for, Marvel can present a "1998 Annual *Starring* Machine Man &amp; Bastion." Anyway, the issue's pretty good and probably would've had a lot more impact for me if I'd read the relevant event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>Man-Thing vol 3 #1-8</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/5/Man-Thing-v3-1-8.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/5/responsive/Man-Thing-v3-1-8-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/5/responsive/Man-Thing-v3-1-8-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/5/responsive/Man-Thing-v3-1-8-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/5/responsive/Man-Thing-v3-1-8-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/5/responsive/Man-Thing-v3-1-8-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/5/responsive/Man-Thing-v3-1-8-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1598" height="1230"></figure>
<p>Between 1997 and 1998, Marvel briefly brought back the classic 1960s pulp title Strange Tales - not merely as a single series, but as an entire brand. The series Man-Thing and Werewolf By Night both have the logo at the top left corner of the cover, as does the "Strange Tales: Dark Corners" one-shot reviewed later in this overview.<br><br>It doesn't sound like it worked out super well, because both Man-Thing and Werewolf By Night were cancelled before their storylines could reach a conclusion. Both characters were brought back later in 1998 for a new Strange Tales miniseries that was intended to conclude their storylines, but that also was cancelled halfway thru its four-issue run. Which is a shame, cause Werewolf By Night is good, and Man-Thing is excellent.<br><br>J.M. DeMatteis has a hell of an imagination - over the course of eight issues, dreams and nightmares and hallucinatory visions and interdimensional visits and planetary travel all flow into each other. Into this mix DeMatteis throws in the occasional random Marvel character - Doctor Strange, Howard the Duck, and Namor all make appearances. It's an imaginative Sandman-esque dreamscape, flowing easily from one issue to another without much care for clearly delineated storyline beginnings and endings. None of it would work without Liam Sharp, who inks his own pencils and creates a very dark and unnatural art style.<br><br>Right at the core of the book there's an extended sequence at an asylum. Not only is it handled tactfully, it's a decent treatment of mental illness. Man-Thing helps a traumatized patient grapple with his demons, at which point the patient decides to start trying to help other patients heal too. I can't say enough good things about this book.</p>

                <p>In the mid-2000s, I saw my first superhero film, and I saw it on the big screen. I ended up adoring Spider-Man 2, as I still do to this day, and immediately went to the bookstore to find Spider-Man comics to read. Marvel was publishing the Essential series at the time, a series of black-and-white collections of the original 1960s books. I devoured every volume I could find, drinking in the soap opera and the rich world and the interesting characters. Occasionally, characters from elsewhere in the Marvel Universe would cameo, like Human Torch or Hulk or Thor, and I would wonder what was going on in their comics.</p>

<p>In 2006, rather than going to a bookstore for the latest Essential volume, I walked into my local comic book store. There, I spotted the latest issue of Amazing Spider-Man on the shelf. The bottom half of the cover was a deep solid red, and other comics in the store had a similar design. I picked up the issue, along with an issue of Wolverine, and an event comic that seemed to tie the two together: Civil War #1.</p>

<p>The way superhero comics are written has evolved a lot over time, but especially over the last twenty years. As comics sales have struggled, Marvel and DC have thrown more and more ideas at the wall, never sticking with any one idea for very long. It's led to a more diverse stable of characters and some truly gripping long-form narratives, and it's even bled over into other forms of media, particularly blockbuster cinema.<br><br>So, because I'm a sucker for superheroes generally and Marvel specifically, I thought it'd be interesting to read the last twenty years of Marvel Comics and witness that evolution. It'd give me an excuse to read some of the all-time great comics runs along the way: Grant Morrison's X-Men, J. Michael Straczynski's Spider-Man, and Brian K. Vaughan's Runaways, just to name a few.</p>

<p>It's a massive and probably ill-advised undertaking, but since when has that ever stopped me? I'm the one who tried to read all of Aristotle's philosophy and got stalled partway through Nicomachean Ethics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>Where to Start</strong></p>
<p>This is going to be a long journey, but it wasn't originally going to be as long as it now turns out it will be. Let me explain.<br><br>I knew I wanted to start reading *around* the time that Brian Michael Bendis took over the Avengers in the mid-2000s. I know that a number of other big runs started around then, and it was pretty close to my original jumping-on point, too.<br><br>But there's a few notable runs that start significantly before that, including the three I listed above (Morrison's X-Men, JMS' Spider-Man, and BKV's Runaways). And there's also Ultimate Marvel, an extremely influential line of comics which launched in 2000 and ran for about a solid decade and a half.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/Intro-part-3-Ultimate-lineup.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-3-Ultimate-lineup-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-3-Ultimate-lineup-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-3-Ultimate-lineup-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-3-Ultimate-lineup-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-3-Ultimate-lineup-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-3-Ultimate-lineup-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1970" height="980"></figure>
<p>So maybe Ultimate Marvel was where I should start looking. Well, I looked at the line-up in late 2000, and noticed that several notable comics were not too far into their run -- notably, the Marvel Knights line, which included reboots of Black Panther and Daredevil, among others. Those comics also have a lot of legacy associated with them. I backed up again.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/Intro-part-4-MK-lineup.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-4-MK-lineup-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-4-MK-lineup-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-4-MK-lineup-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-4-MK-lineup-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-4-MK-lineup-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-4-MK-lineup-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="3808" height="1968"></figure>
<p>Turns out the Marvel Knights line started in 1998. Maybe 1998 should be my new starting point, I thought. But *then* I noticed that lots of the main Marvel titles, such as Fantastic Four and Avengers, had been very recently rebooted at that time. In fact, nearly every major Marvel property, except for the X-Men, received a reboot around 1998.<br><br>One more time I moved backwards on the timeline, and this time I found my starting point. In 1996, the supervillain Onslaught attacked the Marvel Universe, and several prominent superheroes seemed to sacrifice their lives to stop him. In reality, they ended up in a pocket universe, where their lives began anew, with new origins and backstories. Marvel outsourced this work to the house of Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld, and called the new reboot event "Heroes Reborn."</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/Intro-part-5-Onslaught-reborn.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-5-Onslaught-reborn-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-5-Onslaught-reborn-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-5-Onslaught-reborn-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-5-Onslaught-reborn-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-5-Onslaught-reborn-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-5-Onslaught-reborn-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="474" height="377"></figure>
<p>This did not go over well with fans. So in 1997, Marvel brought all those heroes back to the main universe and rebooted all those titles *again* with the redundantly-named event "Heroes Return." It's a new beginning with new creators on many titles, and an attempt to recapture some of what made classic Marvel Comics good. This relaunch seemed to be a solid starting point for my project.<br><br>A few very notable, very long-running titles also began around that time: the wise-cracking Deadpool and villains-turned-heroes Thunderbolts both launched around that time. So I started with those, along with the Heroes Return comics, and decided I'd pick up new series as they hit. Before too long, I'd picked up nearly every issue that got published in 1998, and went back a few months to pick up context, too. <br><br>(I got lucky with the X-Men. Even though they were not officially a part of Onslaught or Heroes Reborn/Return, they went thru an event of their own called Operation Zero Tolerance in 1997, so I began reading in that event's immediate aftermath.)</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/Intro-part-6-Starting-line-up.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-6-Starting-line-up-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-6-Starting-line-up-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-6-Starting-line-up-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-6-Starting-line-up-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-6-Starting-line-up-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Intro-part-6-Starting-line-up-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="2788" height="1078"></figure>
<p>So this is my starting point. 1998, with twenty years to go until I catch up. There's a few issues from 1998 I didn't read: I skipped reprints, and I skipped Marvel's Star Trek comics, which were cancelled very early in 1998 anyway.<br><br>The plan is, every six to twelve months of reading, I'll write up a new analysis. See where Marvel's at, what's changed, how things are going. This first analysis will be a bit longer as it also has to cover some issues from 1997 that gave me context.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>Overall Impressions, Before We Begin</strong></p>
<p>There's a very classic feel to many of these comics. Some of this is probably Marvel trying to recover from the intense tone of their mid 90s comics in general, and of the Onslaught and Heroes Reborn events in particular. But there's a few 90s-style badass grim action types still around in books like X-Force, Cable, Maverick, and Wolverine. <br><br>I've looked at the titles listed for January of 1999 for reference, and nearly all of Marvel's long-running titles are cancelled or rebooted in 1998, except for a few notable X-books. (Uncanny &amp; adjectiveless X-Men, X-Force, Generation X, Cable, Wolverine, and X-Man survive in the near future.) As far as I can tell, this is the closest Marvel's ever come to wiping the board clean and starting with all new #1 issues, at least until the repeated Marvel Now reboots of the 2010s.<br><br>There's some really good writing in here. Now I know why people like Kurt Busiek and J.M. DeMatteis are considered all-time greats - but I'll get to that later.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>Alpha Flight vol 2 #1-13</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/Alpha-Flight-v2-1-13.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Alpha-Flight-v2-1-13-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Alpha-Flight-v2-1-13-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Alpha-Flight-v2-1-13-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Alpha-Flight-v2-1-13-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Alpha-Flight-v2-1-13-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Alpha-Flight-v2-1-13-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="2764" height="1202"></figure>
<p>I was going to skip Alpha Flight, but they kept popping up in other series, so I finally picked it up. The core conceit is that Canada's premiere super-team is being manipulated by a corrupt government agency. The pacing is weird - I think it takes a little too long for the heroes to realize that their memories have been manipulated. A dozen issues in, and they're just now starting to shake off the effects.<br><br>Much like some other series I've read that don't seem to trust they'll survive past a year (Thunderbolts, Ka-Zar), Alpha Flight reaches a big climax at issue 12. It has an official crossover with Uncanny X-Men at one point, but otherwise is surprisingly self-contained given how much it was advertised elsewhere.<br><br>The highlight of these is certainly issue 13, an experimental issue which follows a government lackey instead of any of the main (and pretty forgettable) heroes. Otherwise, I think writer Steve Seagle limits the book, as he does over in Uncanny X-Men. He's just not evocative in his writing or rich in his characters. He's going for a classic superhero style, but in a way that's kinda drab and boring. I'm hoping the book turns around in its final half-year, but I'm not really expecting it to.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong>Amazing Spider-Man #432-437</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/Amazing-Spider-Man-432-437.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Amazing-Spider-Man-432-437-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Amazing-Spider-Man-432-437-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Amazing-Spider-Man-432-437-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Amazing-Spider-Man-432-437-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Amazing-Spider-Man-432-437-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/4/responsive/Amazing-Spider-Man-432-437-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="7536" height="1964"></figure>
<p>In 1998, Bob Harras was the Editor-in-Chief at Marvel Comics. (He would go on to become the EIC at DC Comics in the 2010s.) He wanted a Spider-Man event that would rival X-Men's Age of Apocalypse, a mid-90s event that temporarily completely changed the status quo, down to ending all of the main X-books for a couple of months and replacing them with alternate universe equivalents. Harras' brainchild for the Spider-Man comics, "The Clone Saga," ended up being overlong and detested by fans. You could understand why I was perhaps a little hesitant to pick up the series involving one of my all-time favorite superheroes.<br><br>But Spider-Man in 1998 is, lo and behold, somehow quite good. There's four series running at the time: Amazing from the 60s, Spectacular from the 70s, adjectiveless Spider-Man from the early 90s, and Sensational from the late 90s. The books are so tightly edited that at times it feels less like reading four monthly Spider-Man titles and more like reading one weekly Spider-Man series, especially whenever they all cross over for a big event.<br><br>This stretch of issues has two events. The first is Spider-Hunt, which follows Spider-Man as he flees mercenaries and tries to rescue Norman Osborn's son. It's a good example of how tightly edited these books are; Spider-Hunt reads like one four-part story across issues from four different series. <br><br>The second event is Identity Crisis, which I think is not only the stronger of the two events, but also one of the better-conceived events I've ever read in a Spider-Man series. The concept is that Spider-Man, still on the run, has decided to adopt a new persona so he can keep fighting crime while staying safe. Peter has understandably come to the conclusion that Spider-Man disappearing at the same time a new hero appears would clue people in to what's going on, so he adopts *four* new identities all at once, two heroic and two... less so. This lets the writers of each series have a little more creative leeway, since each gets to write the adventures of only *one* of the four new personas. It's a strong concept, and the writers all seemed to have a lot of fun with it.<br><br>That brings us to the '98 writer of Amazing, Tom DeFalco. He's a fill-in writer in a lot of other places this month, and he's written about half the What If issues I've read, but this is his main book. For the longest-running Spider-Man book of all time, he's a solid choice. DeFalco has a very traditional style, from his dialogue to his plotting. I think Amazing takes the fewest risks of the four Spider-titles - the villainous character DeFalco's obsessed with, Black Tarantula, is really nothing to write home about - but it's also not the worst of them, and occasionally has a really stand-out issue, such as when Spidey uses all four of his new identities at once to fight supervillains. I particularly enjoyed the crossover with Generation X where Peter turned into a monstrous half-spider, but I'm kind of a sucker for weird shapeshifting stuff.</p>

<p>Marvel's gimmick for 1998 annuals is that every single one is a two-character crossover. It's a pretty good idea - if you don't care about one character, you might care about the other - and as far as I can tell, this is the only time in history that Marvel has ever done this. Devil Dinosaur &amp; Moon Boy aren't all that interesting, and the Circus of Crime is never really a formidable enemy, but the issue's okay. I look forward to Devil Dinosaur getting his female companion in the 2010s. </p>

<p>I don't know at what point Avengers became Marvel's showcase blockbuster crossover comic. Maybe to some degree it always was; what with all the B-tier characters coming together, its inherent crossover nature is a bit of a distillation of some of the core of what Marvel Comics is all about: many heroes in a single unified universe.<br><br>Anyway, Kurt Busiek takes that idea and runs with it, and just damn this is a beautiful bombast of a thing. Busiek's Avengers is considered one of the all-time great runs; now I know why. It starts with a classic lineup - Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Carol Danvers, and two New Warriors. It's absolute bloody chaos - within the first issue, the Avengers lose a fight that causes all of reality to shift to a medieval fantasy for a couple issues. I give George Perez and the art team a lot of credit for taking complicated setups and making it all look cohesive and bold. This was easily one of the most *fun* series to read in this whole thing.<br><br>Now: Busiek is also writing Thunderbolts, and I'll get to that one, but here's a tease: Thunderbolts has some of my favorite writing in this whole project. Its characters are freaking incredible - and the character writing in Avengers is just not quite up to that level. Given how iconic these Avengers are, and how Busiek was able to pretty much create the Thunderbolts himself, it's clear to see why. This isn't a character-driven comic, it's a blockbuster action film. And that's fine.<br><br>When the book does go for character drama, it stumbles. Busiek's a core orchestrator of the first big crossover of 1998, "Live Kree Or Die," which tells a four-part story across four series: Iron Man, Captain America, Avengers, and (of all things) Quicksilver. The core of that story is the Avengers trying and failing to stage an intervention for Carol Danvers, who's lost some of her superpowers and has resorted to alcohol. It's a messy story that's super disappointing given how great of a character Carol will be in the mid 2010s, when she becomes the new Captain Marvel.</p>

<p>One of the early Avengers storylines involves them battling Squadron Supreme, a superteam I didn't find to be all that remarkable. The Avengers find the Squadron kind of annoying because the Squadron is being mind-controlled for the umpteenth time, and I couldn't help agreeing with them. This annual finishes off the Squadron's storyline with the Avengers, and sends the Squadron back to their own universe, where they'll finish their story in a one-shot later this year. It's a decently satisfying conclusion that's been oddly shunted out of the main series, but frankly freeing up time to deal with other more interesting foes in the main series is something I'm fine with.</p>

<p>Of the three X-Men solo books starring grim and gritty dudes, Cable has the strongest reason to exist: Cable's from the future and trying to stop shit going down that'll cause disaster in his home time. This doesn't play a major plot role in every single issue, but it is kinda always in the background and definitely gets mentioned every month, which gives you a little more of a hook to keep coming back - what's gonna happen, is he gonna fix everything?<br><br>The six-parter I started out with, The Hellfire Hunt, is the strongest writing in the book that I've seen yet, and also the most relevant to that core plot. Since then the comic has generally leaned on guest characters like Domino and Ulysses Klaw, but it's still been reasonably entertaining, and I'm someone who can get tired of the Grim Superhero Guy genre *real* fast. Especially a guy like Cable, relic of the 90s grimfest that was Marvel Comics, who looks like he has an entire kitchen pantry glued to his outfit.</p>

<p>This is really the only Cable issue I've read that touches on the post-Onslaught event most of the X-books went thru, "Operation Zero Tolerance." Cable faces the villain of that event (Bastion) and also a brainwashed Machine Man. It's extremely basic.</p>

<p>Mark Waid's a super solid writer, and has stuck with Marvel all the way thru 2019. Volume 3 is actually the second part of his run on Captain America, but it's a fine jumping-on point.<br><br>The overall Big Question that Waid's run grapples with is, what are the ramifications of being worshipped as a hero? (X-Man is dealing with this question in his own comic, too.) It runs through the whole series right up to the three-part climactic "Power &amp; Glory" storyline, in which an alien Skrull impersonates Captain America and uses the trust people have in Cap to announce a Skrull invasion that hasn't actually happened, thus spreading paranoia and fear. I don't think the comic handles it all that well - mostly, Steve mopes for a while, but otherwise he doesn't really do anything he wouldn't have done otherwise.<br><br>On the other hand, some of the things this series does are really fun. Waid's great at setpieces, like when Cap has to escort two kids thru a museum, or when Cap fights Hydra on a boat and loses his shield. Waid's also not afraid to handicap Steve to raise the stakes. I've had fun with this title.</p>

<p>Daredevil is one of those characters who can get so far into dark noir tone territory that I can barely tell what's going on. And indeed that is the case for the first two or three issues, co-written by Joe Kelly. Kelly has a bit of a mixed reputation with me so far in this project - his Deadpool is all over the place, but his X-Men is some of my favorite comics of 1998.<br><br>Once other writers come into play, Daredevil gets much better. Chris Claremont helps write the finale to the storyline where Karen Page is under investigation, so the issue when the trial takes place is really solid, even with a supernatural enemy mucking up proceedings.<br><br>Then Scott Lobdell of all people comes in to write a four-parter called Flying Blind, and this is some of the best Lobdell I've ever seen. The premise is that Daredevil's had his memories rewritten for a covert SHIELD mission, and the one SHIELD agent looking out for him and directing him is killed by mistake. It's up to Daredevil to figure out who he is and how to get home with no memories or outside help. That's a solid hook! And the drama is really good, with Matt's friends at home trying to find him, and Matt's villains recognizing him long before he's figured out why they know him.</p>

<p>Deadpool had a couple of limited series before this outing, "The Circle Chase" and "Sins of the Past." Both hit in the mid-90s and both were part of the dark edgy violent 90s crowd. The Deadpool that 2020 audiences know and love - always wise-cracking, and frequently breaking the fourth wall - first got codified in this, his first ongoing series.<br><br>Over the years, the best Deadpool stories I've encountered have used Deadpool's jokiness as a front for some really tough questions about heroism in the face of trauma, and about Deadpool's very identity. Joe Kelly starts to get into some of that here, but it hasn't yet been refined. In one storyline, Deadpool stages a prison break for Typhoid Mary, a woman with multiple personalities. She proceeds to test his heroism by killing people, to see if he'll unheroically take her down to stop her. In the process, Deadpool's ideas of himself as a hero break down because he doesn't know the right thing to do - he doesn't want to hurt Mary who's obviously suffering, but his hesitation causes other people to die.<br><br>Deadpool only has stories like that every so often at this point, though. The biggest flaw I find with this series so far is how much of a chore it can be to read. Deadpool's a very wordy character, and a lot of the jokes don't land. I also don't like the story's treatment of Blind Al. She's a blind old lady who serves as Deadpool's companion, and early in the series it's unclear if she's his prisoner, or if she's just hanging around cause Deadpool's not actually all that menacing to her and cause she has nothing better to do. Later in the series, though, he tortures her by placing her in solitary confinement, and when she gets out her first reaction is to... try to change him for the better. Rather than fleeing Deadpool and his abusive treatment, she stays because she cares about him too much. This sucks.</p>

<p>Elektra is the worst comic I've read in this project so far. For a long time, that dubious honor went to X-Man, and I'll get to why later. But then I struggled thru this series of issues and X-Man lost its crown.<br><br>Everything about this series is absurdly gross and sexist as fuck. The dialogue leers at Elektra's features like a horny twelve-year-old. The plot sees men taking advantage of Elektra over and over, both villain and hero alike. (Daredevil is her lover for an entire two issues before dumping her.) The art puts her in impossible poses constantly so her boobs and butt are always on display. The stories are boring and unoriginal, the guest characters are often written completely out of character, and Elektra herself is pretty unlikeable. She deserves better.<br><br>There's a couple of side characters that I did end up growing to like. Elektra has a dance instructor towards the beginning of the series, who starts out pretty unlikeable, but then a villain's scheme ends up permanently swapping him into the body of a young woman. I liked seeing him come to grips with that. And Elektra has a young ward named Nina who is briefly brainwashed by the Hand ninjas before she and Elektra save each other. Unfortunately, the series ends on a huge cliffhanger, with Nina having turned evil again, and the world on the hunt for Elektra. As far as I can tell, that cliffhanger won't be resolved anytime soon. Good riddance. Elektra, and Marvel, deserve better than this.</p>
