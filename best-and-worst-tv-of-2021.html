But in a way, the battle was won in the year's first month. LOVE, CHUNIBYO &amp; OTHER DELUSIONS just affected me that much.<br><br>[title]<br><br>It's a bit hard for me to articulate just why this series worked so well for me, but here goes. Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions follows two high schoolers, Yuta Togashi and Rikka Takanashi, who live next door to each other. Rikka is "afflicted" with something the Japanese call "chunibyo," and which loosely translates to "middle schooler syndrome." Effectively, she believes that she has exceptional magic powers, which only she can see. She's effectively playing pretend 24/7, and couldn't stop if she wanted to.<br><br>Rikka recognizes Yuta as a former "chuuni," and so the two form an uneasy friendship, with their social circle slowly growing over the course of the series. Eventually, Rikka and Yuta begin a romance, and face some difficult questions. What does it mean to date somebody who believes she is a dark sorceress? Is love as much of a delusion as chunibyo? What caused Rikka to become a chuuni in the first place?<br><br>[image 1]<br><br>Rikka seems like the sort of character who, in any other piece of media, would be the butt of a joke. Indeed, there are many comedic shenanigans over the course of the series about how silly it is that Rikka believes she's a dark sorceress. But the heart of LC&amp;OD is much kinder and warmer than I was led to believe by the premise. The show ends up kind of being about what it's like to date somebody who's neurodivergent, or even sometimes what it's like to date somebody AS a neurodivergent person. Everybody around Rikka - her sister, her friends, her boyfriend - cares about her very much. And even if the "magic" that Rikka creates isn't real, in other ways it very much is. Rikka brings the group of friends together and helps them bond in powerful, even magical ways.<br><br>Kyoto Animation, the studio that produced both seasons of Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions, previously made a series called The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, a show about a girl who had powerful magic but didn't know she was using it, and mostly used that power to be an asshole. Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions is like the polar opposite of that show: Rikka has less power than she thinks she does (or does she?), but she uses that power with kindness and love.<br><br>[image 2]<br><br>I loved the characters of this show. I loved the ridiculous situations they got into, particularly when the animation really went all-out with the "magical" situations that Rikka and her friends could see around them. The series is endlessly creative in both seasons. But most of all, the series really touched me because I saw important aspects of myself represented and depicted with empathy and humanity. That's one of the most powerful experiences with a show I've had all year.</p><p>Â </p><p class="align-center"><strong>#2</strong></p><p>This year was rather infamously so full of good anime that it was impossible to get to most of it. I still have a fairly long list to get through. But while most people were obsessing over Wonder Egg Priority in the winter, I had my heart stolen by OTHERSIDE PICNIC.<br><br>[title]<br><br>Based on a light novel series, Otherside Picnic is about a couple of girls who find their way to an alternate universe full of strange horrors and eldritch abominations. One girl has the ability to see invisible spirits, and the other girl has the ability of owning a firearm, and together they decide to take on contracts to hunt down otherworldly horrors and bring them back home.<br><br>In concept, the show honestly does not have a lot to it, although it IS specific enough to be the exact short of bullshit I love. But in execution, this show is gay as fuck. It is not quite as gay as the light novel series (but I imagine that if this show were to ever get a second season, kissing would be involved), but the way these two young women bond is incredibly gay and very sweet.<br><br>[image]<br><br>I don't really have a lot more to say about this show other than that if this already sounds like your bag, definitely check it out, cause I think it was mostly overlooked. It's just kind of cool to see a couple of girls kicking ass and falling in love in another world together. This show ruled.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 5, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/tags/best-of-the-year/">Best of the Year</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/authors/harmony/" class="invert" rel="author">Harmony</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/best-movies-of-2021.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Best (&amp; Worst) Movies of 2021</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-01-04T20:05" class="feed__date">January 4, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/best-movies-of-2021.html" class="invert">Best (&amp; Worst) Movies of 2021</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-01-03T16:02" class="feed__date">January 3, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media-journal-best-games-of-2020.html" class="invert">Media Journal: Best Games of 2020</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-01-02T11:54" class="feed__date">January 2, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media-journal-best-tv-shows-of-2020.html" class="invert">Media Journal: Best TV Shows of 2020</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
