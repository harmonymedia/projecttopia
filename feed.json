First of all, even the expansive list of games I'll talk about here are a mere fraction of the games I played in 2021. Many were left unfinished, but I still found them interesting enough to talk about.</p>\n<p>I thought I had locked in my game of the year within the first couple of months. Nearly three quarters into the year, it was unseated by what is now the number two slot. And more recently, the number two slot was unseated yet again by this, the most stunning game I played all year: the queer visual novel <strong>Heaven Will Be Mine.</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_title.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_title-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1010\" height=\"560\"></figure>\n<p>Heaven Will Be Mine is the standalone follow-up to another visual novel which a lot of my friends have played and enjoyed: We Know The Devil, a story about three queer characters who go to summer camp and encounter the Devil. We Know The Devil had a premise that didn't entice me, but when I heard that Heaven Will Be Mine was mostly about cute queer girls in mechs engaging in transhumanism, I couldn't start playing it fast enough. It's like if somebody made Neon Genesis Evangelion with lesbians.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap01.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap01-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1314\" height=\"862\"></figure>\n<p>Actually, it's even better than that. Heaven Will Be Mine is the story of three girls, at least two of whom are trans, who each act as key agents in a three-way galactic war. Humanity has abandoned Earth, and the galaxy's three main factions all have different ideas about how to proceed with life: return to Earth and embrace their humanity, escape to the stars and embrace a totally different type of nonhuman existence, or find a different sort of in-between existence which respects and remembers their past while still embracing a new future. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap02.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap02-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"996\" height=\"546\"></figure>\n<p>You play as one of the three girls (Luna-Terra, Saturn, or Pluto) and engage in conversations with the other girls in a visual novel format. During each conversation scene, you're given choices that influence the narrative towards one of four different endings, most of which favor a single faction but one of which is a happy medium between the three. There is emphatically not a canonical ending; even the most balanced one has a degree of uncertainty to it. There is also not a \"correct\" character to play as; any of the endings can be obtained with any of the playable characters. </p>\n<p>That said, each character also has unique scenes, so there's substantial motivation to try playing as each girl. And I did; I played through the story multiple times to see all the scenes and outcomes, and to get to know each of the characters and their motivations better. This is the only game this year that I restarted as soon as I finished it - multiple times.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap03.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap03-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"997\" height=\"557\"></figure>\n<p>Even with that amazing premise, Heaven Will Be Mine could have been... just fine, a totally functional queer-girls-in-mechs story, and it probably still would have earned a slot on this list. But Heaven Will Be Mine actually changed me, just as much as the characters themselves are changed in the game. I saw aspects of myself echoed back to me via the characters of Heaven Will Be Mine, aspects that were sometimes painful to confront but that I needed to. These are aspects that could have led to the girls' downfall if any of them had been acting alone - but at the climax, the three characters always work together to lift each other up and build a future together.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/01hwbm_cap04.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/01hwbm_cap04-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1097\" height=\"614\"></figure>\n<p>My GOTY last year was Sayonara Wild Hearts, a game with minimal gameplay but with a story, aesthetic, and message that I really needed to hear in a difficult year. Heaven Will Be Mine is the same thing to me this year. It taught me that love can be more than a feeling: it can be a radical act. It helped me remember who it is that I want to be.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#2</strong></p>\n<p>While Heaven Will Be Mine was my favorite overall experience of the year, <strong>Deathloop </strong>had my favorite gameplay of the entire year. I didn't replay it immediately on finishing, because I had too much else to do and also I'd had a great experience in my first playthrough, but I strongly considered it. It was a fantastic game, and in many ways an ideal game for me.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/02deathloop_title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Now, Deathloop received widespread critical acclaim upon release, but discussion around the game quieted down pretty quickly. I'm pretty sure that's because Deathloop was not widely available to most people. Deathloop was released exclusively to the PS5, a notoriously difficult console to obtain, as well as the PC - and most gamers play on console. Being fortunate enough to own a PC that could run Deathloop, I picked it up on a whim towards the end of September, and was blown away.</p>\n<p>The marketing for this game was pretty bad. For many months leading up to Deathloop's release, the central conceit and gameplay of Deathloop was not clear to me. It seemed to be a multiplayer PvP assassination game, but with time loops involved somehow? A few days before the game's release, reviews cleared things up: Deathloop is a single-player first person stealth assassination game, which has an optional multiplayer element. And I would have loved this to have been clear from the start! I've adored the Hitman games for years; playing Hitman as an FPS sounded amazing.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/02deathloop_cap01.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap01-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1087\" height=\"563\"></figure>\n<p>And it was! Deathloop is the story of one man, Colt Vahn, who find himself trapped on an island where a large number of people have decided to erect a time loop and party for the same day in perpetuity. Your goal as Colt is to run the loop as many times as it takes until you're able to assassinate all eight targets whose lives are tied to the time loop's existence; kill all eight, and you can break the loop and end the game.</p>\n<p>That's the sort of premise that could seem very overwhelming, especially once I tell you that each day is broken up into four sections, and you have the option of traveling to one of four areas of the island for each island, and the targets move around between the various areas as the day progresses. But it's all right, because Arkane has designed the game to be pretty straightforward and relatively linear. Rather than strategizing the perfect series of kills like you might in Hitman, Deathloop lays out several sidequests called \"leads,\" each of which teaches you how to alter the timeline just right to get your targets into the right places, so you can kill them all in a single run of the loop.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/02deathloop_cap02-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap02-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>And once I learned about this, my initial worry was that Deathloop would be too linear. But it's actually a welcome bit of structure that kept me focused on a limited number of questlines, while still allowing a great degree of freedom regarding how I completed them. And there's still plenty of X-factors to keep the game interesting, like the various mooks you'll encounter, as well as the primary antagonist Julia who sometimes shows up to hunt you and completely wreck your plans. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/02deathloop_cap03.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/02deathloop_cap03-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Deathloop is an extremely playable game. I generally felt like I had a manageable number of tools, but a large sandbox with which to play with them. There's plenty of hidden secrets and a few optional questlines that I was never actually able to finish. And the story does end very abruptly when you finish the game (a point of contention among players), but I found that the story drove the gameplay as much as it needed to and no more. This was an extremely fun world to explore; I especially loved how a mid-afternoon blizzard transformed the world into a quiet peaceful snowscape. I loved uncovering all the game's secrets, getting to know the characters and the locations, and having my own little world to feel a little bit safe in.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#3</strong></p>\n<p>So, my twice-dethroned GOTY still retains the title of my favorite sandbox of the year. <strong>Hitman 3 </strong>is an incredible achievement, both as a standalone element of a fantastic trilogy, and also as a complete package that includes all 25 levels of the World of Assassination trilogy.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/03hitman_titlejpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_titlejpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>When I first found out about the Hitman series reboot, it seemed very much up my alley. Hitman is a stealth assassination game whose main gameplay loop is to find a set of clothes that will get you into a restricted area, get to that area, and then repeat until you're able to get to your target, kill them, and escape the level. Hitman's first game consists of six huge levels with countless assassination opportunities in each level, and encourages replay with an in-game checklist which recommends different types of kills. It emphasizes comedy and player agency above all else. </p>\n<p>My early experience with this game series was attempting to 100% each level's objectives before moving on to the next level - which took a very long time. Early in the year, when Hitman 3 released, I decided to finally run the trilogy, playing each level once and then progressing to the next one in order to sample all of the levels and experience the full story. I played through about twenty levels across three games in quick succession, which was an incredible narrative and gameplay experience.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/03hitman_cap01.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap01-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Hitman 3 kept me coming back for months afterwards, too. In addition to the massive checklists, IO Interactive continually released new limited-time targets over the course of the year, as well as special in-game events. I was addicted to the gameplay of Hitman 3 for months, finally falling off sometime in June. </p>\n<p>Hitman 3 couldn't quite retain its GOTY crown for a couple of reasons. First of all, taken on its own, Hitman 3 is just more Hitman. It's a series of incredible twists on the formula, don't get me wrong; each level seems to be an attempt to adapt a different genre into a Hitman level. The first level's Dubai skyscraper feels like a Mission Impossible movie, the second level's old British Dartmoor mansion plays like an Agatha Christie novel, the third level's dark Berlin rave party is a John Wick movie, etc. And yet despite the brilliance of the level design, and the fun popcorn twists of the story, all of this *is* essentially more of the same Hitman game I've been enjoying for a couple of years now. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/03hitman_cap02.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/03hitman_cap02-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Secondly, even grading Hitman 3 based on the quality of the trilogy as a whole (which I could do, since I experienced most of the trilogy for the first time this year, and Hitman 3 does contain the entire trilogy's levels), there just isn't *quite* enough going on to justify it beating Deathloop or Heaven Will Be Mine. It is a fun and funny stealth open world action game that I will enjoy for years to come, but it didn't quite stick to my soul the way those other two games did. No matter; it's still a fantastic game, and a great conclusion to the trilogy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#4</strong></p>\n<p>My fourth favorite game of the year is the best writing in any game I played this year. (I told you this year's GOTY list was a difficult battle.) <strong>The Forgotten City </strong>began life as a player-created mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, so within the limited gameplay capabilities of Skyrim's engine, writing was really the only card it could play. Still, what a success: The Forgotten City played its card masterfully, unparalleled to any game I played this year.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/04forgottencity_title.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_title-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1091\" height=\"591\"></figure>\n<p>In yet another of 2021's many timeloop games (others have discussed this phenomenon at length, so I won't get into it here), the protagonist of The Forgotten City is a modern person who finds themself transported back in time to an underground Roman city. There, the player finds that the city's inhabitants are trapped in this city, and if they break an uncertain code they dub \"The Golden Rule,\" all of them will be slaughtered by the city's golden statues. The city's leader has summoned you from the future and created a stable timeloop because he has learned that somebody will break the Golden Rule, and he tasks you with finding out which individual that could be.</p>\n<p>From there, the game branches out into a web of possible leads or sidequests, helping you learn about the inhabitants' various problems and hopefully solving enough of them that nobody will break the Golden Rule at the end of the day and destroy their world. As with Deathloop, while there are many different paths, the game subtly guides you carefully through the story while still allowing you to follow your whims.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/04forgottencity_cap.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/04forgottencity_cap-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1078\" height=\"604\"></figure>\n<p>And the characters' stories are very very compelling. The dialogue is all drenched in Greco-Roman philosophy and mythology. I'm reminded of the philosophical dialogues within the puzzle game The Talos Principle - but whereas that game used philosophical discussion as a mode of self-expression, The Forgotten City is telling a very specific story, and wants to alert you to various thinkers and myths that add color to that story. </p>\n<p>And what a story it is. Late in the game, The Forgotten City reveals itself to be about the trauma of cultural heritage. As the city's secrets are unveiled, The Forgotten City becomes not just a story about myth and philosophy, but a story about how we treat each other, both on an individual level and on a broader societal level. It's a story about the cycle of history that I genuinely did not expect from something that started as a Skyrim mod, and I'll be thinking about its ideas for a long time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#5</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga</strong> is my favorite platformer of the year.

I began with Lego Star Wars, originally released from 2005 to 2007. Since it's the first Lego game they made, my expectations were pretty low, but it ended up being easily my favorite of the series. </p>\n<p>Lego Star Wars was originally released in 2005 as an adaptation of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, to coincide with the theatrical release of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. After critical acclaim, TT released the immediate sequel the following year: Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. This game refined and expanded upon some of the ideas of the first installment. A year later, in 2007, TT released Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, which bundled together the levels from all six movies and retroactively edited the levels of the prequel trilogy to be more in line with the design of the original trilogy levels.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/05legostarwars_mycap.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/05legostarwars_mycap-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/05legostarwars_mycap-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/05legostarwars_mycap-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/05legostarwars_mycap-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/05legostarwars_mycap-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/05legostarwars_mycap-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>If we presume that Lego Star Wars was in development for a couple of years before the first game's release, then this was effectively a single game that TT developed and continually refined over the course of half a decade. And the refinement SHOWS. The levels of Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga are all a good length and have plenty to do in them, each one filled with collectibles that help you unlock more and more interesting and varied characters. There's a significant amount of bonus content, and if you go for 100% completion, there's a lot to keep you busy. But it's all incredibly compelling stuff.</p>\n<p>After Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, TT worked hard to release new Lego games at least once a year, and sometimes multiple times per year. I played further games in the series this year, and they all felt a bit rushed compared to Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, all broken in little ways that were never refined in their own game but would be worked on in future games. I think eventually TT made games nearly as good in the mid 2010s, such as Lego Marvel Superheroes and Lego Lord of the Rings, but perhaps not quite as fully realized as the world of Lego Star Wars.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#6</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/06unpacking_title.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_title-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_title-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_title-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_title-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_title-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_title-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1010\" height=\"561\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Unpacking </strong>is the best short game I played this year, and also the best happy little surprise of the year. (See, everything on the game list is a superlative, this was a tough list!) And here I really have to thank Xbox Game Pass for a second, a game subscription service without which I would have tried fewer games in 2021. It's thanks to Game Pass that I was able to try games like The Forgotten City and Unpacking on a whim, and I adored both of them.</p>\n<p>Unpacking has about the coziest game loop you can ask for. It's as straightforward as the title suggests: you are given a room and a bunch of boxes, and it's your job to unpack all the boxes and find a place for all the items inside it. The items range from toothbrushes to tiger plushies, and the levels get harder as you go: first you have a small number of items to unpack in a decently sized room, but later in the story you have accumulated more items, but also you're living with other people and have to find place to stash your stuff alongside theirs.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/06unpacking_cap.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_cap-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_cap-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_cap-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_cap-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_cap-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/06unpacking_cap-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1017\" height=\"573\"></figure>\n<p>Yes, \"story,\" because Unpacking's slyest trick is that it actually tells a complete narrative from start to finish, just through this gameplay loop. Through environmental clues, it's easy to tell that you begin by unpacking boxes into a dorm room at college, and later into a communal house, and then later into... well, that'd actually be spoilers to say. But it's a sweet little story, and makes some interesting points along the way. </p>\n<p>I think the coolest part about Unpacking is that the passage of time it depicts is really familiar to me. As the years go on, the player character collects a large series of fantasy novels, more and more sketchbooks for their job as an artist, and evolving game consoles as technology marches on. This ends up being a poignantly nostalgic picture of growing up over the last couple of decades, and I loved that.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#7</strong></p>\n<p>I've read the contemporary typical transgender coming out story in many forms at this point - friends' twitter threads, independently published light novels, even graphic novels. By and large, it is not a narrative that has made its way to the mainstream yet; trans stories in mainstream media are still on shaky ground, mostly because queer creators are drawn to independent publication. So I was incredibly surprised - and moved - to find that trans coming out narrative depicted with incredible sweetness in a game published by a major studio: <strong>If Found</strong>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/07iffound_title-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_title-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_title-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_title-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_title-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_title-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_title-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>If Found sells itself on its gameplay gimmick. It's a visual novel, but in order to progress the narrative, the player must erase each line and image of the visual novel. There is a genuine in-universe reason for why this is, which is only revealed very late in the story, but the act itself is a bit unnerving: just as you're learning about all these characters and situations, you must erase them, as if the player character is erasing them from their memory.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/07iffound_cap.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_cap-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_cap-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_cap-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_cap-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_cap-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/07iffound_cap-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>If Found tells the story of Kasio, a young Irish person who has recently come out to her family and friends as a trans woman. As the story opens, she has a fight with her parents about her life choices, and runs away from home. She ends up staying with her friends, and together they decide to start a band. </p>\n<p>Kasio's journey, along with her friends, is not an easy one. It's a journey of uncertainty and hardship and poverty. But it's also a journey of joy and self-discovery and love. Most of all, it's about Kasio learning how to live as herself and fully experience life. And the climax of this narrative made me cry a lot. In some ways this story is a little cliche, but seeing it told in this way and on this platform meant more than words can express.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#8</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/08tetris_title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>Well it only took three goddamn years!! <strong>Tetris Effect Connected </strong>is perhaps one of the best modern iterations of Tetris ever made, and I've been waiting impatiently for the game to finally make it to Switch. And here it is, three years after initial launch, and I played it through to the end and enjoyed the hell out of it!! Was that so hard?</p>\n<p>Tetris Effect is a highly audiovisual experience that also happens to have a Tetris game inside it. The game of Tetris hasn't changed since the 1980s; there's a couple of extra gameplay gimmicks this time, like the ability to slow down time when your meter builds up, but generally speaking the goal in each stage is to complete a certain number of lines before time runs out, as tetrominoes are thrown at you faster and faster. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/08tetris_01-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_01-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_01-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_01-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_01-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_01-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_01-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>What makes Tetris Effect unique is the quality of the experience. Each stage has beautifully generated backgrounds and incredible music that really turns Tetris into even more of a spiritual experience than it already is. In one stage, you might be clearing lines to the sound of dolphins cresting the waves; in another, your line clears might trigger fireworks of celebration.</p>\n<p>And this was a quality that the makers of Tetris Effect decided to leverage by releasing it exclusively for, of all things, the Playstation VR headset. Which I'm sure was a beautiful audiovisual experience, but VR isn't that accessible of a platform, and the Switch had already been out for a year and a half when Tetris Effect released in 2018. A year later, the Xbox received an expanded version of Tetris Effect that included multiplayer: Tetris Effect Connected. There it stayed, exclusive to Xbox for two whole years. FINALLY, this year, the Switch got Tetris Effect Connected. It's about gods damn time.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/08tetris_02.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_02-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_02-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_02-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_02-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_02-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/08tetris_02-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>Tetris Effect is a beautiful experience.

Now, when I heard this, I presumed we'd be getting something like Coffee Talk - a game in which you play as a barista and make coffee drinks in order to progress the story. That was also a visual novel, so it wasn't a stretch to imagine.</p>\n<p>No such luck. Necrobarista is a mostly completely hands-off visual novel. The twist this time is that it's not static images and backgrounds, as most VNs are (including every other visual novel on this list). Instead, Necrobarista renders 3D environments in real time and physically places the camera in different angles in the environment in order to tell its story. Every so often, there's an intermission in which you can actually walk around the main coffee shop where the story takes place, and find collectibles that will give you new little side stories.</p>\n<p>As innovations go, this idea is cute, but I'm not sure it adds all that much to the story. A little visual flare and a distinctive visual style, sure. But honestly, a lot of visual novels are able to do that without this sort of technology.

The story follows both the coffee shop's employees and its visitors. Some of them are alive and some are dead, and nobody can immediately tell that distinction.

At its core, Necrobarista is about one idea: in this coffee shop on the threshold of the afterlife, its workers have never really figured out how to cope with death.

But if you'd prefer to play as a werewolf, then \"Werewolf: The Apocalypse\" has you covered. </p>\n<p>Video games have tried over and over again to adapt tabletop RPGs to the video game medium, and generally not with a lot of success. But one major difference between Dungeons &amp; Dragons and the World of Darkness books is that the World of Darkness is much less focused on combat than D&amp;D, and much more focused on narrative. So maybe a visual novel is one of the best possible ways to adapt these RPGs.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/10WTA_cap01.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/10WTA_cap01-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/10WTA_cap01-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/10WTA_cap01-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/10WTA_cap01-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/10WTA_cap01-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/21/responsive/10WTA_cap01-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1012\" height=\"566\"></figure>\n<p>Werewolf The Apocalypse: Heart of the Forest is a visual novel about a young woman who finds herself drawn to a mysterious forest in eastern Europe.

The Anthropocene Reviewed is an idea John had for grading various aspects of the human experience on a five-star scale, like Diet Dr. Pepper, the Lascaux Caves, Halley's Comet, and Humanity's Capacity for Wonder.<br><br>The Anthropocene Reviewed began life as a podcast, and has now been turned into a book. And full disclosure: I haven't finished it yet. The essays in Anthropocene are usually just a few pages, but they are emotionally weighty and incredibly beautiful. They're hard to binge. You read one, sit with it, and come back later and read another one.<br><br>I don't stop that from letting me review and rank this book of reviews myself, though. (One of my favorite books of all time is a French tome called \"How To Talk About Books You Haven't Read,\" which I have of course never finished.)<br><br>Over the last two years, it feels like humanity as a species has had a collective crash course in our own mortality. It's been so easy to be confronted with the terrible parts of the world, that sometimes a little beauty and hope is a necessary and healing thing. And The Anthropocene Reviewed is that book, partly written during the pandemic and thus seemingly a direct counter to some of that hopelessness.<br><br>I cannot honestly describe The Anthropocene Reviewed as anything other than a spiritual experience. A series of loosely connected essays becomes a story about our world, ourselves, and the relationship between those two things. As this and other sources have reminded me so long, we are not separate from the world, but part of it. \"What a blessing to be Earth loving Earth.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#2</strong></p>\n<p>There's quite a few standalone graphic novels I read and enjoyed this year; it's a seemingly very healthy market, and frequently a queer one as well. And my best graphic novel experience of the year was <strong>Girl Haven</strong>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/02girlhaven.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"288\" height=\"426\"></figure>\n<p>I bought Girl Haven on a whim, because a friend got it and heard it was good, and I was looking for good books earlier in the year. Girl Haven just so happened that I received it the weekend I also received my vaccine. The vaccine shot knocked me on my ass for two days, and it was hard to do very much other than lie around. But Girl Haven was a quick read and mostly pictures, so I could at least read that.<br><br>Girl Haven is one of the best depictions of gender questioning and coming out as trans that I have read in a piece of mainstream media. Ash is a young boy whose mother disappeared into another dimension three years prior. When Ash and his friends find their way into that dimension, they find that this world is a world where only girls live. And yet somehow Ash was able to arrive here - so what does that mean for him?<br><br>There are a lot of trans coming-out stories that involve fate intervening to alert the main character that they might not be the gender they thought they were. It's a common fantasy among trans people to time travel back in time and tell your younger self what's going on, to avert years of heartache and confusion. But where Girl Haven becomes really special for me is how it subverts this expectation. Not long after arriving, Ash and his friends actually do find a group of boys who think that Ash could be their prophesized king and savior. So while the initial trip to this \"girl haven\" helped Ash to start questioning things, the story ultimately positions itself so that Ash has to be the one to do the work and make the decision for himself about what gender to be - and, indeed, Ash ends up coming out as a girl in the climax.<br><br>Girl Haven is a sweet book, and the best thing it could do would be to be that introduction to a new world that other young trans people might need, which Ash is lucky enough to receive. In my case, I found the story deeply relateable, smartly told, and resolved really sweetly. I highly recommend it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#3</strong></p>\n<p>There's a bit of a bittersweet twinge to this one. Manga, I've now learned the hard way, frequently does not stay in print very long. The printed edition of any given series usually lasts many volumes, and it just doesn't make sense for a publishing house to keep every volume it's ever produced in active circulation. That unfortunately makes it difficult to acquire certain series. Still, I'm glad I found <strong>A Certain Scientific Railgun vol 1</strong>, even if I may not be able to read very much of the series.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/03railgun.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/03railgun-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/03railgun-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/03railgun-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/03railgun-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/03railgun-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/03railgun-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"306\" height=\"436\"></figure>\n<p>In the 2000s, Kazuma Kamachi began a series of light novels entitled \"A Certain Magical Index,\" a series about an alternate universe in which many people have supernatural abilities. Its protagonist is a boy whose ability is to cancel out others' abilities, which is a superpower that I personally find really boring.<br><br>However, Magical Index has had several spinoffs, and its most popular one is the manga series A Certain Scientific Railgun. As the title implies, it focuses more on the sci-fi side of this alternate reality than the fantasy side that Magical Index does. Its protagonist is Mikoto Misaka, a girl who can control electricity, and whose ability to fling projectiles at lightning speed have earned her the nickname \"Railgun\".<br><br>There's not a lot to this series other than that. But I was drawn in by how unabashedly girly it is, while also remaining very much a shonen action series. That's uncommon. Nearly the entire main cast is girls, except for the protagonist of Magical Index who pops up occasionally in a supporting role. The series is mostly about Mikoto and her core friendgroup, engaging in battles with people and uncovering the city's dark secrets.<br><br>Scientific Railgun is still running, with new volumes being produced and subsequently translated into English. But upsettingly, Seven Seas, which owns the license, only keeps the first couple volumes and the most recent few in print, which makes it very difficult and expensive to obtain further volumes of this series. Still, this peek into the world was a great one, and I do hope to read more of it in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#4</strong></p>\n<p>I've been a fan of the film Scott Pilgrim vs the World since it came out in theaters. It's the last movie I saw in theaters before heading off to college, and I've watched it many times since. Scott Pilgrim vs the World is a funny and extremely creative adaptation that pays homage to countless other series and types of media. Most impressively, it adapts moments from the comics directly, imitating the comic book form in ways I've never seen anywhere else before or since. So it was a matter of time before I made my way to the <strong>Scott Pilgrim series</strong> of comic books, but this year I finally arrived there.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/04_scott.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/04_scott-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/04_scott-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/04_scott-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/04_scott-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/04_scott-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/04_scott-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"8328\" height=\"2064\"></figure>\n<p>Scott Pilgrim vs the World set my expectations high. It's a memorable film, and I've seen it so many times and quoted it at length with my friends (\"BREAD MAKES YOU FAT???\"), that I had very specific expectations for the Scott Pilgrim books. Those expectations were not met - and what I found was in some ways better and in some ways worse.<br><br>So let me set the scene real quick. The Scott Pilgrim series was published between 2004 and 2010, and the film came out in August 2010, a month after the final book was published. Observe that that is not quite enough time to tell a story fully accurate to the comics. Only the first two books, \"Precious Little Life\" and \"Vs the World,\" are adapted in the movie pretty accurately.<br><br>So, the Scott Pilgrim series is a story about Scott Pilgrim meeting and dating Ramona Flowers, and subsequently battling her seven evil exes. Each book covers one of the exes (book 5 covers a pair of twins that are always together). What I noticed is that starting in book 3, the movie cuts a LOT out. Whereas Scott takes several encounters and a lot of training to beat the third ex, in the movie the encounter happens in a single scene. <br><br>I'm going to hazard a guess that about four of the books were finished by the time the film went into production - but Bryan Lee O'Malley was on hand enough to give some guidance to where the story should end up. Books 3 and 4 feel very long. They do come together eventually, but there's just a lot of filler that the movie wisely cut.<br><br>But books 5 and 6 are really good, far better than the movie. They make the last act of the movie feel really rushed, actually. As the series culminates, the books do a couple of things that the movie misses out on. First, it does a better job of giving proper resolutions to a lot of its supporting cast, who just get throwaway lines of resolution in the movie. Secondly, it actually gives Ramona a much better ending to her character arc. I think it also puts Scott and Ramona in a much stronger position to try to grow and be better people together at the end.<br><br>Scott Pilgrim vs the World (the movie) is a flabbergasting thrill ride of whiz bang pop culture, extremely fun and creative but with a decent heart to it. Scott Pilgrim the book series is slower, but also a bit more accurate to the feeling of being part of a friend group. People hang out at parties, they drift away, they come back together a little to help fight each other's battles. I love watching the Scott Pilgrim movie, but I think I liked living in the world of the Scott Pilgrim books a little better.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#5</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/05s.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/05s-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/05s-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/05s-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/05s-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/05s-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/05s-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"322\" height=\"499\"></figure>\n<p>This book is a little bit hard to talk about. In the early 2010s, fresh off of Star Trek and a few years away from Star Wars, J.J. Abrams came up with the concept for a book which would include a lot of little extra documents and goodies crammed into its pages - newspaper clippings, postcards, even napkins with scribblings on them. He commissioned writer Doug Dorst to come up with <strong>S.</strong>, an impressive tome that I have tried and failed multiple times to finish, including this year.<br><br>S. takes the form of a library book (inside a slipcover case so you don't lose any of the little bits and bobs) called \"Ship of Theseus.\" This book is supposedly the nineteenth and final novel written by the fictional author V.M. Straka. The novel itself is about an amnesiac man who finds himself in a small fishing town, and subsequently goes on a series of adventures, including a pirate ship and a bloody rebellion.<br><br>But that's not all that S. is about, because in the margins of this book are scribbled notes written by two people reading this book. The book's owner is a student working on this book as part of his thesis, and the book's second author is another student who found the book, read it, and started writing notes to its owner on a whim. The two trade scribbles back and forth throughout the entire book, and as their relationship progresses through time, the color pens they use also changes, so that it's a bit easier to keep track of when in time each note is being written. </p>\n<p>In theory, this SOUNDS like House of Leaves, a famously labyrinthine book heavily inspired by the works of Jorge Luis Borges, which was filled with footnotes (many of which lead to nothing) and included a substantial frame narrative and substantial appendices, including an entire secondary novella within one of the appendices. House of Leaves is one of my favorite books, a marriage between a horror story and a love story, and it's extremely complicated to read.<br><br>But in practice, S. is mostly a love story between the two readers of \"Ship of Theseus\" as they chase down leads in a global conspiracy against the author V.M. Straka and people who ally themselves with him. It's very J.J. Abrams for most of the plot's intrigue to be in the margins regarding the story's metatextual narrative, rather than in the novel itself. Honestly, I found the metaplot very hard to follow, but the love story is nice. And while the novel \"Ship of Theseus\" may have been sort of meant more as a canvas for the love story than anything else, the novel \"Ship of Theseus\" itself is very well-written. It's visual, it's engaging, it's extremely political (and still relevant today), and it reads plausibly as a book that could have believably been written in the early 1900s. <br><br>On all levels, S. is a great read. The book's major downside is that it is so complicated to read that if I put it down for too long, I forget all the details I've been trying to precariously hold in my head. But that just means it'll still feel fresh next time I try to read it. Maybe next time I'll even finish it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>RUNNERS-UP</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/runnersup_jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/runnersup_jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/runnersup_jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/runnersup_jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/runnersup_jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/runnersup_jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/runnersup_jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"9296\" height=\"2280\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#6</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Lightning Thief </strong>was technically a re-read, and thus its ability to qualify for this list is hazy. However, the last time I read The Lightning Thief, I didn't care for it, but this time I enjoyed it a lot more and am hoping to continue reading the series. It's a fun YA spin on Greek mythology in a contemporary setting, but most impressive to me in 2021 is how unquestionably neurodivergent its main character is, and that his stranger qualities end up being crucial to the story's progression and resolution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#7</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ranma 1/2 vol 1-4 </strong>is very much a comfort read, but I think still deserves a place on this list. It's a manga which was formative for many trans people I know, but which I missed out on growing up (I went for Inuyasha and Fruits Basket instead). The genderbender martial arts manga features a genderfluid protagonist who spends a lot of time engaging in very feminine activites, such as ice skating and rhythmic gymnastics. It's a strange and sweet kind of escapism.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#8</strong></p>\n<p>The only superhero comic to make my list this year is <strong>Shadow of the Batgirl</strong>, a standalone graphic novel about a young Cassandra Cain and her journey to becoming the Batgirl. Cassandra Cain is a traumatized ex-assassin who's illiterate, mute, and alone, but she escapes her abusive home and takes shelter in Gotham, and with the help of a ramen restaurant owner and Barbara Gordon, she learns how to become a hero she's proud to be. It's a sweet coming of age story with beautiful art, and a lovely introduction to a less popular superhero.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#9</strong></p>\n<p>A beautiful manga recommended to me again and again was <strong>Witch Hat Atelier vol 1</strong>, and it did indeed turn out to be right up my alley. This story - about a young girl who discovers magic and is subsequently whisked into the forbidden world of witchcraft - has a lot of similarities to other stories I've loved this year, including The Owl House (TV) and Atelier Sophie (game). Still, the sweet story and gorgeous art were hard for me to not love. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#10</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, the tenth item on this list is <strong>The Witch Boy</strong>, a queer coming-of-age graphic novel by Molly Knox Ostertag. Similarly to Girl Haven, The Witch Boy is a story about a boy who doesn't really belong with other boys, and finds himself drawn to magic that only girls can use. His coming out about this to his parents at the story's end really reads as a trans coming out moment. However, the main character never actually changes his gender identity, and the boys' magic he shows little interest in is shapeshifting, so elements of the story didn't speak to me as much as Girl Haven.</p>",

Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions follows two high schoolers, Yuta Togashi and Rikka Takanashi, who live next door to each other. Rikka is \"afflicted\" with something the Japanese call \"chunibyo,\" and which loosely translates to \"middle schooler syndrome.\" Effectively, she believes that she has exceptional magic powers, which only she can see. She's effectively playing pretend 24/7, and couldn't stop if she wanted to.</p>\n<p>Rikka recognizes Yuta as a former \"chuuni,\" and so the two form an uneasy friendship, with their social circle slowly growing over the course of the series. Eventually, Rikka and Yuta begin a romance, and face some difficult questions. What does it mean to date somebody who believes she is a dark sorceress? Is love as much of a delusion as chunibyo? What caused Rikka to become a chuuni in the first place?</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/01LCOD_cap02.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap02-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap02-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap02-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap02-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap02-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap02-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"738\" height=\"381\"></figure>\n<p>Rikka seems like the sort of character who, in any other piece of media, would be the butt of a joke. Indeed, there are many comedic shenanigans over the course of the series about how silly it is that Rikka believes she's a dark sorceress. But the heart of LC&amp;OD is much kinder and warmer than I was led to believe by the premise. The show ends up kind of being about what it's like to date somebody who's neurodivergent, or even sometimes what it's like to date somebody AS a neurodivergent person. Everybody around Rikka - her sister, her friends, her boyfriend - cares about her very much. And even if the \"magic\" that Rikka creates isn't real, in other ways it very much is. Rikka brings the group of friends together and helps them bond in powerful, even magical ways.</p>\n<p>Kyoto Animation, the studio that produced both seasons of Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions, previously made a series called The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, a show about a girl who had powerful magic but didn't know she was using it, and mostly used that power to be an asshole. Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions is like the polar opposite of that show: Rikka has less power than she thinks she does (or does she?), but she uses that power with kindness and love.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/01LCOD_cap.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/01LCOD_cap-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1018\" height=\"568\"></figure>\n<p>I loved the characters of this show. I loved the ridiculous situations they got into, particularly when the animation really went all-out with the \"magical\" situations that Rikka and her friends could see around them. The series is endlessly creative in both seasons. But most of all, the series really touched me because I saw important aspects of myself represented and depicted with empathy and humanity. That's one of the most powerful experiences with a show I've had all year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#2</strong></p>\n<p>This year was rather infamously so full of good anime that it was impossible to get to most of it.

(Oh, uhh, get used to that trope, there's a lot of that on this list.) Luz quickly befriends an old witch lady named Eda, and persuades Eda to teach her magic, which had always been her dream. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/03OwlHouse_cap01-2.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap01-2-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap01-2-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap01-2-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap01-2-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap01-2-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap01-2-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1004\" height=\"562\"></figure>\n<p>The Owl House is kind of a weird mishmash. One of the gimmicks of the show is that the Demon Realm isn't the fantastical world Luz expected it to be, but instead is sort of gross and very dangerous. It's kind of like Harry Potter as written by the Rick and Morty team. And there is A LOT of Harry Potter in the bones of this show. Very quickly, Luz is admitted to a school for magic in the Demon Realm, and there are plenty of jokes at Harry Potter's expense. </p>\n<p>The series also seems to have borrowed its main relationship from Little Witch Academia, another animated series that took strong influence from Harry Potter. Amity, who goes to Luz's witch school, is at the top of her class and a huge bully. But as Luz and Amity get to know each other, they develop a friendship which eventually blossoms into romantic feelings. But whereas Little Witch Academia took the show's entire 25 episodes to get its leads to the point of \"friendship plus maybe a bit more.\" The Owl House feels like it's speedrunning that relationship. Just 16 episodes in, the two share a prom night together; a few episodes later, Luz and Amity actually ask each other out.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/03OwlHouse_cap02-2.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap02-2-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap02-2-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap02-2-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap02-2-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap02-2-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap02-2-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1012\" height=\"570\"></figure>\n<p>Now, I actually think The Owl House is a landmark piece of queer kids' animation on the level of Steven Universe (which was my show of the year in 2019) and She-Ra (my show of the year for 2020). It's not even just the core relationship, although that is fantastic. As a whole, the Demon Realm seems to be a metaphor for queerness, or at least for not really belonging in the life you grew up in. In addition to being bisexual, Luz Noceda is also canonically neurodivergent, and she takes to learning magic way better than she took to school in her old world. She even has to learn differently from her peers at her witch school because of her lack of natural magical ability. It's overall a fantastic depiction of growing up in a strange world, and learning how to become yourself even when that self is strange.</p>\n<p>But I also think The Owl House takes a while to really become great. A lot of the first season feels like... for lack of better terminology, \"traditional Disney kids' adventure show,\" like DuckTales or Gravity Falls. The good bits are there, but they're in between a lot of Harry Potter jokes.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/03OwlHouse_cap03-2.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap03-2-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap03-2-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap03-2-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap03-2-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap03-2-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/03OwlHouse_cap03-2-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1021\" height=\"568\"></figure>\n<p>When Disney cancelled the show during its first season's run (\"coincidentally\" immediately after Amity was revealed to be gay during the prom episode), it felt like showrunner Dana Terrace and company decided to really go all out. Season two (which will be the final full length season) gets deep into the complicated backstories of its characters. It deals with mental health, complicated parental dynamics, and queer relationships at length. It introduces its first nonbinary character and gets queerer every episode. I really liked the show in season one; I fell head over heels for the show in season two.</p>\n<p>If more of season two had aired in 2021, this might have become my show of the year. As it is, what we got was enough to make it very close. The Owl House is a phenomenal piece of work, and I'm extremely excited to see the rest of the series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#4</strong></p>\n<p>The highest praise I can give to <strong>Flip Flappers</strong> is that it made me look at all other media differently. It's going to affect how I look at relationships in media (and in the world, for that matter) for a long time. That's how effective this show was at telling its story.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/04flipflap_title-2.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_title-2-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_title-2-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_title-2-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_title-2-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_title-2-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_title-2-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1009\" height=\"563\"></figure>\n<p>Flip Flappers is a show about a girl named Cocona who meets a very strange girl named Papika; together they fall into an alternate dimension (take a shot) called Pure Illusion. There, they are tasked with finding and retrieving \"amorphous fragments\" and bringing them home to Papika's organization for unknown reasons.</p>\n<p>I actually didn't really put together how similar this show's plot is to Otherside Picnic until I typed it out. It's even more similar when I tell you that the two lead girls develop a very gay relationship over the course of the series. But no, this is different from Otherside Picnic, I promise.</p>\n<p>Whereas Otherside Picnic was sort of dark and violent, Flip Flappers is much more playful and childish. \"Pure Illusion\" has the feel of a giant playground where Cocona and Papika get to use their powers together. The playful nature actually adds a lot to the show's messaging, as the characters grapple with what it means to add a sense of unreality to their world - through childish imagination, psychosis, or whatever it is that's going on. </p>\n<p>At least, sometimes they're grappling with that sort of thing. Other times they're piloting a giant mech together, or fighting monsters in a desert. This show is just damn fun.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/04flipflap_cap-2.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_cap-2-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_cap-2-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_cap-2-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_cap-2-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_cap-2-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/04flipflap_cap-2-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1013\" height=\"566\"></figure>\n<p>Flip Flappers is produced by the same studio that made Princess Principal, one of my favorite shows that I watched in 2020. In Princess Principal, the two main girls frequently disguise themselves as each other in order to commit heists and confuse both their enemies and their peers. Sometimes their identity confusion even affects themselves; Ange and Charlotte each had to learn how to live the other's life.</p>\n<p>Flip Flappers does something a bit similar and a bit more straightforward. Papika and Cocona get their powers activated when they feel empathy for each other. When the two are transformed, they work extremely well together, and even look very similar to each other, down to swapping hair colors. Flip Flappers isn't just a show about love; it's about how love makes people work together better as a unit, and maybe even become a bit more like each other, or even something greater than the sum of their parts. That's something I've been noticing in more and more places since watching Flip Flappers, which to me feels like solid evidence that the show has left a serious mark on me.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#5</strong></p>\n<p>I said this list was a real battle: the previous #5 slot was solidly in place for a long long time, but then got bumped down to position #6 right at the end of the year.

As I dealt with a major crisis in February, the show was there for me, an anchor to unreality when my reality was becoming stressful and difficult - which just mirrors a bit too well what the characters of WandaVision are going through.<br><br>Not only was WandaVision exciting from week to week, but it was also tightly focused, and stuck the landing on its ending. It also had a profound message that I needed to hear. No other Marvel show has managed to come close to doing that. WandaVision set the bar too high.<br><br><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/06WV_cap01.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap01-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap01-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap01-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap01-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap01-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap01-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"753\" height=\"567\"></figure><br>Following the traumatic events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, Wanda Maximoff and the android Vision have retired to a small West Virginia town to live a quiet peaceful life. There's just one problem: Vision died in Infinity War, so how can this reality be? As their reality slowly begins to fall apart, Wanda and Vision try to figure out what happened together, to ultimately devastating results.<br><br>WandaVision is presented as a series of pastiches of sitcoms. Most episodes parody a sitcom from a specific era - the Dick Van Dyke show in the 50s, for example, or Modern Family in the 2000s. The composers made an entirely new theme song for each era, but with every song containing the same four-note theme. It's a neat touch.<br><br><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/06WV_cap02.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap02-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap02-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap02-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap02-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap02-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/06WV_cap02-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1009\" height=\"416\"></figure><br>Once things finally fall apart for good, the last episode is essentially just a third act of a Marvel movie. I kind of thought that was cool, that WandaVision was positioning Marvel movies as an ultimate evolution of the sitcom format - easy to digest entertainment that ultimately keeps the same status quo from week to week.<br><br>WandaVision is a show about a lot of things. It's a show about processing grief and trauma - and a year into the pandemic, that's something I needed to hear. It's about love, and abuse, and where the line between those is. It's about being a damn cool little mystery that adapts some of the strangest popular stories in the Marvel canon.<br><br>Marvel sort of fell apart for me as a brand in 2021. Between the movies and shows this year just being kinda okay, and also the imperialistic and militaristic nature of the conflict in Marvel projects feeling harder and harder to stomach, I fell out of love with Marvel. But WandaVision still strikes a chord with me. It's a story about two people trying to make the best of things together. I can relate to that.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#7</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/07JJK_title.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/07JJK_title-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/07JJK_title-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/07JJK_title-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/07JJK_title-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/07JJK_title-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/07JJK_title-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1012\" height=\"570\"></figure><br>The story of the <strong>Jujutsu Kaisen </strong>anime is good for the same reasons the manga is good, and I read the manga first and will also cover it on the relevant list.

The Jujutsu Kaisen manga art style is sketchy and angular; it's very distinctive and full of character. Jujutsu Kaisen's anime goes for a very different art style. Everything is vibrant and colorful, the spirits look eerie and often translucent, and in general things are a bit more rounded than angular. The character designs are still very much intact, but this world has a different and perhaps slightly more approachable feel than the manga's.<br><br>As for the story, Jujutsu Kaisen's anime really hit home just how much I loved so many of these characters, and remembered the storylines from the manga beat for beat. I hadn't quite realized how much I like the story until I saw it again in a different medium. Overall, JJK was an incredibly enjoyable experience, and I'm eagerly anticipating the prequel movie's US release.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>RUNNERS-UP</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/runnersup01.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup01-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup01-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup01-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup01-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup01-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup01-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2362\" height=\"1200\"></figure>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#8</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Space Force </strong>was probably my biggest surprise of this year. The Trump administration is not the sort of subject I usually find funny, especially since that admin weaponized humor to gain power. But Space Force is more of a comedy about modern government in general, and what it means to have goals and ambitions in a world driven increasingly crazy by late-stage capitalism. Carrell and Malkovich especially are a blast, but the entire cast is having a lot of fun, and I'm interested to see where season 2 goes after that cliffhanger.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#9</strong></p>\n<p>Disney put out two animated anthology shows in September, and <strong>Star Wars Visions </strong>really put Marvel's What If to shame. While What If's episodes all have the same monotonous and rotoscoped visual style, Star Wars Visions is a group of Star Wars shorts conceived and produced by a smattering of major anime studios across Japan. Visions is the most creative Star Wars thing I've seen since The Mandalorian's first season, and it's also a love letter to both Star Wars and anime. I enjoyed the heck out of every episode.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#10</strong></p>\n<p>Most of the Marvel shows this year were a bit of a wash for me, but <strong>Hawkeye </strong>had smaller ambitions than most of them, and as a result worked a lot better than others. Hawkeye is basically a Christmas movie (can the dad make it home in time for Christmas?) dressed up as a Marvel film. The action scenes are fun, and there's tie-ins to the greater Marvel chronology, but generally in ways that work. Best of all, Hawkeye really humanizes Clint Barton; he's very much over the whole hero thing, and has a sweet relationship with his family. Hailee Steinfeld also kills it as the new Hawkeye, Kate Bishop.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/runnersup02.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup02-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup02-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup02-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup02-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup02-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup02-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2852\" height=\"948\"></figure>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#11</strong></p>\n<p>Documentaries aren't usually my go-to, but this year I watched some of <strong>The Last Dance</strong>, a retrospective about Michael Jordan's basketball career, with extensive interviews with Jordan and his teammates. It dramatized a years-long sports career in a compelling way, and was a fascinating picture of a guy with a huge ego who maybe actually deserves to have one, as well as an interesting snapshot of the 90s.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#12</strong></p>\n<p>Since this was the year I really got into Shonen Jump manga, it feels only fitting that I experienced some <strong>Gintama </strong>as well, a Jump comedy *about* Jump. Well, Jump's in it a lot, and the main characters read it a lot, but Gintama is mostly about a group of mercenaries who actually seek out jobs to help people, rather than killing them. It's a huge mishmash of characters, and I especially liked the cute alien girl.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#13</strong></p>\n<p>Due to all the drama about Cowboy Bebop the live-action show, I finally got around to starting <strong>Cowboy Bebop </strong>the original animated series. As a first impression, it's very good. The show is very slowly building its world and its characters, and I've been particularly impressed by the storytelling's efficiency while maintaining a languid pace. Hoping to catch the rest of this next year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#14</strong></p>\n<p>I was surprised to learn that after creating My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Lauren Faust and co-writer M.A. Larson jumped to DC to create <strong>DC Superhero Girls</strong>, a cute animated series about a group of high school age superhero girls (Batgirl, Supergirl, Green Lantern, Bumblebee, Zatanna, and Wonder Woman). The stakes tend to be pretty low, but the stories are fun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/runnersup03.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup03-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup03-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup03-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup03-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup03-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/runnersup03-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"4160\" height=\"1488\"></figure>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#15</strong></p>\n<p>The first few episodes of <strong>Resident Alien</strong>, a mystery/thriller/medical/sci-fi story starring an alien who wants to take over the world from a small town, were zany and really fun. Alan Tudyk is clearly having fun playing the alien character, and I enjoyed the show's take on neurodivergence.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#16</strong></p>\n<p>Chef David Chang hosted a 12-episode series for Netflix called <strong>Ugly Delicious</strong>. The stated premise of the show is to investigate every possible variation of particular types of food - for example, the first episode is about pizza, from the fanciest New York slices to the cheapest Domino's slice. Chang gives every class of food the time of day, no matter how strange or maligned. And as a result, the show ends up being about far bigger ideas than just the food we eat. It's also about how it gets there, and who makes it. A fried chicken episode becomes about racism, a Mexican food episode becomes about immigration, and a curry episode becomes about the homogenization of Asian foods. It's a fantastic show that any food lover should give a try.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#17</strong></p>\n<p>I had high hopes for <strong>Zombieland Saga</strong> a heavily memed show about a group of idols who are also zombies, prominently featuring a canonically transgender character. The show ended up merely being very good, but it's still a commendable show. The songs, performed by our zombie idol heroes, are all bops, and the comedic bits and dramatic character arcs all work really well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#18</strong></p>\n<p>A quieter release on Disney+ this year was <strong>Just Beyond,</strong> a sort of Twilight Zone for kids. It is amazing. Oh, it's not very good. Most of it is corny, and a lot of the messaging doesn't land; only a couple episodes are really quality. But this show was still about as fun to watch and riff of as the real Twilight Zone, and leagues better than the recent Twilight Zone remake, so I thought this was definitely worth my time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>WORST TV OF 2021</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/worst.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/worst-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/worst-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/worst-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/worst-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/worst-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/19/responsive/worst-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"8424\" height=\"2480\"></figure>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#1</strong></p>\n<p>WandaVision set the bar high for Disney+ Marvel shows; <strong>The Falcon &amp; the Winter Soldier</strong> buried that bar in the dirt. The Falcon &amp; the Winter Soldier wants to be a thoughtful critique of racism in the Marvel universe; what it ends up actually being is six episodes of long-winded rationalizing to itself of why there \"needs\" to be a Captain America, when Sam Wilson was already doing perfectly fine as the Falcon. Not for the first or last time in the MCU, the villains here are a group of leftists; this time they're anti-nationalists who have good ideas but whose main problem is that they just really love killing people. Daniel Bruhl reprises his role as Baron Von Zemo, but his role here is even less consequential than his dumb part in Captain America: Civil War. Worst of all, A LOT of the discourse surrounding this show was about John Walker, the well-meaning fascist soldier who briefly takes on the mantle of Captain America. I hate that the team that made this show will go on to make more Captain America movie, because my only hope leaving this show was that they'd let somebody else write Sam next time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#2</strong></p>\n<p>I know it's a classic, and I was all jazzed up to watch this in preparation of going through the entire Studio Trigger canon. But <strong>Gurren Lagann </strong>really, really, really did not work for me in its first few episodes. It's sexist, it's homophobic, and it's honestly kind of boring for a mech show. I know it gets better, but I just don't know that I have the patience to wait until it does.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#3</strong></p>\n<p>I had heard promising things about <strong>I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level</strong>, a harem isekai with a girl in the lead role for once, and primarily girls in its supporting roles. Maybe, I thought, populating this genre with lesbians might actually make it tolerable for me. NOPE. This show is still pretty gross. Oh well, it was worth a shot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#4</strong></p>\n<p>Falcon &amp; Winter Soldier could have been a blip; maybe it was just a bad team. The premise and writing of <strong>Loki </strong>looked cool. But Loki was my biggest Marvel disappointment this year. After a couple episodes of Loki being a time detective with Owen Wilson (COOL?!), Loki leaves the agency and teams up with a female alternate universe version of himself for a couple episodes. Then he leaves her behind, meets a bunch of other alternate Lokis, there's a big fight against a cloud, and an unrelated bad guy monologues for a bit. Roll end credits. What a slapdash mess. You can really tell that this show's scope was cut down by the pandemic, given how many scenes are just two or three people in a room, but I'm not sure a lack of pandemic could have saved this show; it's just too much of a clusterfuck.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#5</strong></p>\n<p>When The Owl House went on hiatus, I really hoped that Disney's newest show, <strong>The Ghost &amp; Molly McGee</strong>, could fill that hole in my heart - a show about a ghost who haunts a girl, only to find that she's very happy to have the company. Unfortunately, the writing for this show really doesn't work for me. It's all just a bit too silly and doesn't build its characters enough.</p>",

This world has smartphones and video games, but it also has a society that's separated into unicorn villages, earth pony towns, and pegasus cities. A New Generation posits that now, more than ever, we all need to come together and learn to love each other, and I think that's really sweet.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/01mlpanewgen_cap.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/01mlpanewgen_cap-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/01mlpanewgen_cap-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/01mlpanewgen_cap-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/01mlpanewgen_cap-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/01mlpanewgen_cap-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/01mlpanewgen_cap-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"422\"></figure>\n<p>The visual style is certainly much different from Friendship is Magic, but it's true to those designs while also updating the look to be, in my opinion, much prettier and higher budget.

The action moves at a brisk pace for such a long film, the actors are all clearly having a lot of fun, and the cinematography and effects are breathtaking regardless of whether you're seeing it on a big screen. It really does make a difference to see a big action adventure movie that takes itself more seriously than the ubiquitous Marvel movies. The epic nature of the narrative is given substantive gravitas, and a lot of the discussions between characters are compelling.

It's a story about two childhood friends, a princess and a pauper, who swapped places during wartime and have now reconnected years later. But that's just the backstory; it's actually *mostly* about a group of five girls who pretend to attend high school but are actually involved in high stakes spy heists from week to week. It's thrilling stuff and the characters are a lot of fun, and the two leads are gay as hell for each other, which is super sweet.<br><br>Princess Principal: Crown Handler is the first of a series of films intended to follow up on the show's twelve episodes. The film is only about an hour in length, which makes it feel less like a feature film and more like a double-length episode of television.

And I liked all of them! Part 2 surprised me with how many iconic action moments it had, and I loved the scene with the architect. Part 4 was complicated and I'm still sitting with it, but was definitely one of the best experiences I had with a new film this year. But part 3, <strong>The Matrix Revolutions</strong>, was the one that really blew me away.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/04matrixrev_title.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/04matrixrev_title-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/04matrixrev_title-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/04matrixrev_title-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/04matrixrev_title-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/04matrixrev_title-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/04matrixrev_title-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1068\" height=\"432\"></figure>\n<p>The Matrix trilogy was really ahead of its time. Parts 2 and 3 take the structure of some two-part sequels from the 2010s, such as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, in which the second half is really an extended third act to the storyline begun in the first half.<br><br>So while The Matrix Reloaded has a fair bit of meandering and philosophizing (most of it quite interesting), The Matrix Revolutions is a nonstop action thrill ride from start to finish.

But the final fight between Neo and Smith is the stuff of legends, which I've definitely seen multiple films take influence from since. Neo's relationship with Trinity is also extremely sweet, and their stories are both brought to fitting ends in this movie. <br><br>I especially love the weird metamorphosis of both Smith and Neo, as they slowly become more like each other: Neo able to interact with and control machines, and Smith getting more chaotic and human-like. Regardless of your ability to see a transgender narrative in the Matrix films, that transhumanism is unmissable. The Matrix Revolutions may be a chaotic ride, but it has so much fun getting there, and in some ways feels like the corniest, girliest action blockbuster I've seen in quite some time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#5</strong></p>\n<p>I think the general expectations of Christopher Nolan have been far too high for a decade now. The last unambiguously great movie he made was Inception in 2010. Since then, audiences have simultaneously gotten tired of his shtick, while also continually expecting him to reinvent the summer action blockbuster.<br><br>I think Nolan's gotten more indulgent over the past decade, and I think that's really good for him. I also think he's gotten more experimental. The Dark Knight Rises, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are all films that didn't work for me on various levels, but they're also pretty different from his previous films. Even when his movies aren't for me, I give him a certain amount of respect.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/05tenet_title.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_title-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_title-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_title-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_title-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_title-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_title-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1078\" height=\"400\"></figure>\n<p>When audiences, movie theaters, and Warner Bros. all expected <strong>Tenet </strong>to save the entire movie industry just four months after a pandemic had forced hundreds of closures nationwide - yeah, those expectations were a bit high. And as with Nolan's more recent films, Tenet is indulgent and experimental. But unlike Nolan's last three, Tenet really worked for me. Go figure.<br><br>Part of it is that, watching at home six months after its theatrical release, I had the time to actually research the movie as I was going through it. The chronological choreography of a lot of the key sequences is pretty complicated, but it is understandable with a little work. And once you're able to untangle all that? Tenet is a damn fun little time travel movie. For real.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/05tenet_cap.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_cap-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_cap-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_cap-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_cap-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_cap-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/05tenet_cap-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1095\" height=\"488\"></figure>\n<p>But I also think Tenet maybe has more to say than people gave it credit for. This year has been a year full of time loops as a story device, and Tenet was already there in 2020. The villains of Tenet (who, surprise!, also turn out to be the heroes) are trying to escape their climate apocalypse future by returning to their past. And what do you know: halfway through Tenet's runtime, the characters reverse their chronology, and the film's ending happens on the same day as the film's beginning. It's a movie about trying to escape cycles by creating cycles of your own, and the repercussions of that. I have to wonder if this film will age better for people with time - but regardless, for me, Tenet is surprisingly relevant and very fun.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><br><br><br><strong>#6</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/06hilda_title.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_title-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_title-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_title-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_title-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_title-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_title-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1439\" height=\"562\"></figure><br>It is no particular surprise that <strong>Hilda and the Mountain King </strong>is the best and most beautiful (in every sense of the word) episode of Netflix's animated series Hilda, which I will also cover in my \"best TV of the year\" list. As a ninety minute feature, Hilda has more time and (I suspect) a bigger budget with which to tell its story. <br><br>To be honest, it wouldn't be inaccurate to consider Hilda &amp; the Mountain King more a triple-sized finale to season two than a movie of its own accord, as it ties up a solid number of loose ends from the latest season. The event that kicks off the movie's plot actually happened in the final moments of the last Hilda episode, and the movie is off and running without much of an explanation to new viewers.<br><br><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/06hilda_cap.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_cap-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_cap-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_cap-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_cap-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_cap-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/06hilda_cap-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1095\" height=\"469\"></figure><br>But I also don't think that'd be entirely fair. While its ties to established continuity are strong, Hilda &amp; the Mountain King's ambitions are enormous, and the movie stands up well on its own as a fable of a girl who's suddenly able to cross species lines she couldn't before, helping bring a sense of understanding between two species on the brink of war with each other.<br><br>Some of the story content of this movie, I expected, given some obvious places the series was going with its second season subplots.

It's not faithful to the games that were out at the time, but a straight movie adaptation of Super Mario World would be really boring. SMB The Movie is a fun and creative romp through a Blade Runner-inspired world. It's corny, it's dumb, and it actually has some pretty great references to the games. I'd actually love to see more movies like this.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#8</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Matrix Resurrections</strong> is my second-favorite Matrix sequel, but it's pretty close. I still feel like I'm digesting this movie, what it means, what it attempted, how it worked, and so on. In the moment, this was a great movie watching experience; I didn't know where the movie was going with everything for the entire first hour. The new characters are super fun and super queer, the villains are great, and the Neo/Trinity relationship remains extremely sweet (and pretty trans). The action scene scope is small due to the pandemic, but I don't even mind. This was a great film.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#9</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Matrix Reloaded </strong>is packed absolutely full of scenes that absolutely define the Matrix series - which surprised me, given how much people deride the sequels. The discussion with the Merovingian, the car chase, Keanu stopping a wall of bullets, the Architect, and the final flight to save Trinity are all fantastic scenes. The movie is too slow to start, with an entire first act set in Zion that doesn't pay off until Revolutions, but once it gets going, this film works great.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#10</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Parasite </strong>is a modern day classic. Everybody should watch it. It's a genuinely great idea and it is absolutely ruthless in how it skewers capitalism as a system that pits people against each other. The only reason it's not higher on this list is because it's a bit of a rough watch, especially the climactic party sequence. But this should be required viewing for any cinema student, or really anybody, moving forward.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#11</strong></p>\n<p>A few Disney animated films hit their streaming service this year, but I only caught <strong>Soul</strong>, released towards the end of 2020. Soul is typical Pixar in a lot of ways, especially in structure. But in its emotional messaging, Soul has the same emotional maturity as Pete Docter's other Pixar films (Monsters Inc., Up, and Inside Out). In an animated world in which so many people (including the protagonist) value life as what you've made in it, Soul counters that the value of life is simply the ability to live, which I think is a wonderful and important message to hear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/runnersup02.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/runnersup02-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/runnersup02-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/runnersup02-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/runnersup02-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/runnersup02-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/18/responsive/runnersup02-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"11152\" height=\"2928\"></figure>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#12</strong></p>\n<p>Every year our household watches a few horror films for Halloween, and the one I enjoyed the most was <strong>Happy Death Day,</strong> a movie about a girl stuck in a time loop on her birthday who can't stop getting killed by a serial killer.

It may be an advertisement for shoes, but it's also wacky cartoon fun with a heartfelt message of friendship at its core. The stakes feel low, but they're just high enough to get the plot moving, and it's a fun movie AND a fun game of basketball.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#14</strong></p>\n<p><strong>O Brother Where Art Thou </strong>is considered one of the Coen brothers' most classic and enduring movies, and is frequently considered one of their best. That reputation perhaps set my expectations a bit too high, cause for me, O Brother Where Art Thou was merely a fun and strange little adventure film about a group of country musicians. Its music will be stuck in my head for years to come.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#15</strong></p>\n<p>Studio Trigger's latest feature film, <strong>Promare</strong>, is the most male character centric film they've made in quite some time.

It's a sweet story about love and empowerment, and its climax is suitably over-the-top spectacular.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#16</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Player One</strong> has a ton of problems, most of them on a story level. At its core it's a story about a white geek going on a standard video game quest, marginalizing the more diverse cast around him. It throws pop culture references at the audience relentlessly. But on the other hand... I really enjoyed seeing people interacting in a virtual world like this. With all the copyrighted characters being thrown around, it really felt like an echo of some of the virtual spaces I've seen in my life, and it was neat to see it visualized on a budget this big.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#17</strong></p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun with dumb movies this year, but none more than <strong>Digimon: The Movie,</strong> a shoddily edited sampler platter of three barely related Digimon projects wrapped in a package of pure 90s.

What a waste of money and what a waste of my time. It is ugly and uninspired, it is a tonal mess, it is creatively completely bankrupt, it is tiring and boring, it tries to send the audience off with an emotional ending that is completely unearned. It is cynically corporate at every single level, and I hated every second of it. This held together far far worse than a movie in the 90s that was essentially a fucking shoe commercial. Fuck this movie.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#2</strong></p>\n<p>The Conjuring movies (and now cinematic universe, for some fucking reason) have honestly aged pretty badly, even the good ones. But <strong>The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It </strong>(which should go down in history as one of the worst sequel titles alongside Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales) is easily the worst of the trilogy and quite possibly the worst of the whole mega-franchise. It is confusing, boring, and morally abhorrent.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#3</strong></p>\n<p>The amazing terribleness of <strong>2025: The World enslaved by a Virus</strong> really needs to be seen to be believed. \"The virus changed the world. Communism is all over the place.\" The idea that covid's main effect on the world appears to have been the criminalization of Christianity is amazing. A government agency is three people in a blank basement with a single laptop and some guns. This movie is dreadful and a lot of fun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#4</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Operation Christmas Drop </strong>is military propaganda in the form of a Christmas movie. It's the story of a Congresswoman who is threatening to cut the military budget for a (real-life) annual project to drop resources to needy islands in the Pacific. The notion that the US would cut the military budget, especially for a purely charitable/propaganda practice, is utterly ludicrous. Other than that, the film is mostly pretty boring.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>#5</strong></p>\n<p>Disney put out a lot of stinkers this year; NONE of the Marvel movies worked for me. But the worst Disney film I saw this year was definitely <strong>Cruella</strong>, an origin story for Cruella de Vil that mostly rips off The Devil Wears Prada, Suicide Squad, and pure unadulterated stupidity. The story about this puppy-killing villain kicks off because puppies LITERALLY KILL HER PARENTS. It is a terrible movie.</p>",

The humans and aliens who previously fought each other are now living in harmony. You play as a squad of mixed species, investigating various forces of unrest in City 31. As is usual for XCOM, you go on various strike team missions in which you take down enemy combatants, and occasionally have other objectives like retrieving intel.<br><br>I've played a lot of video games (if this blog is any indication), but in a lot of ways I'm still pretty new to gaming, and I'll happily take an easy way into a popular genre. Chimera Squad is a great entry point. Your teammates can't die; they just fall unconscious, and can be revived back at base. This gives me the freedom to play around in both the combat sections and the base-building sections, without stressing too much about my entire team dying.<br><br>Plus, the peacebuilding aspect of Chimera Squad really really appeals to me. There's more work put into the story and characterization here than in any other XCOMs I've played. And most importantly, my XCOM team has a big buff alien girl who punches enemies in the face and who shrugs off wounds as \"just another scar,\" and I'm pretty gay for her. Chimera Squad feels like it was made for me.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>2) Control</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/Control-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>It's taken me a few tries to really get into Control. I originally bought this game last year, but it didn't click. I was sold on Control being really weird, like the game equivalent of \"SCP Foundation,\" a blog about weird and fantastical artifacts. But Control isn't weird, not at first; it's a basic cover-based shooter that mostly takes place in office hallways, the most boring possible setting.<br><br>I'm glad that Humble gave me a second opportunity to try this out, because this time I actually got into it. It was a pretty close race between first and second place for the best game of the month, and the next few games after that were pretty close behind. March was an unusually good month for Humble.<br><br>Control is a game about Jesse, a woman who arrives at a Manhattan office building called the \"Federal Bureau of Control\" under mysterious circumstances. Almost immediately, she's been made the new Director of the Bureau, and it's up to her to eradicate a malicious force known as the Hiss from the building.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/Control-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Control-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><br>I've seen some pretty weird shit. Control is not that weird. It has weird circumstances, like how quickly Jesse is put in charge of the secret organization she just discovered the entrance to. It has weird little details; sometimes they're written into the assorted documents scattered around the building, or sometimes they're in the garbled voice messages Jesse discovers from dead people and otherworldly beings.<br><br>But the gameplay itself? Very standard. Oh, you get powers, but it's stuff like throwing around pieces of floor with your mind, or a speed dash, or different flavors of gun. When you defeat enemies and capture a control point, you flatten out a room's convulted nonsensical architecture into something more boring and office-y. True to its name, Control is about keeping some measure of control over the strangeness in your life.<br><br>But it's a fascinating little story, with intriguing characters. And it's gorgeously made. Whoever had to program all the little particle simulations for smashing anything into anything had their work cut out for them. Ultimately, the Metroidvania exploration nature of the gameplay makes this a game that I want to keep messing with, to see what else I'll find as I dig in. It's not an amazing game, but it's pretty neat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>3) Elex</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/Elex-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Elex-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Elex-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Elex-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Elex-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Elex-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Elex-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>THQ Nordic is a very strange studio. They're known for indie games and for low-budget blockbuster games, like the Darksiders series and the Red Faction series. I never know quite what to expect when I start up one of their games.<br><br>Elex feels like it doesn't have quite enough money behind it to do what it was trying to achieve, and yet also way more than I expected. It takes place in post-apocalyptic North America... well, okay, actually the wikipedia page tells me it takes place on another planet, but it sure LOOKS a whole lot like post-apocalyptic North America. And it's very very pretty!!

You're given a sword at first, which makes the game feel like high-budget Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, or alternately low-budget Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. That extends to the conversations you can have with NPCs, which are way way too long and which you can't skip. This game needed some serious editing.<br><br>I rank this game pretty highly because it's a genuinely pleasant game to wander around in. It feels like if Fallout stamped on the breaks and focused less on the combat and more on the pleasant quiet solitude of an empty landscape. I appreciate that more than I can say.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>4) Pesterquest</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/Pesterquest-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Pesterquest-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Pesterquest-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Pesterquest-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Pesterquest-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Pesterquest-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Pesterquest-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>This is the part of the list where I have to emphasize that this list will betray my own biases pretty strongly. I'm a long-time Homestuck fan, which means a Homestuck video game is something that'll appeal to me more than it would to other people.<br><br>Pesterquest is a visual novel that takes place in the Homestuck universe. Supposedly it's a sequel to Friendsim, a previous game made by the same team, but I haven't gotten around to playing Friendsim. As it is, Pesterquest sees an unnamed player character falling into the Homestuck canon and experiencing non-canonical conversations with key Homestuck characters.<br><br>The obvious benefit to this arrangement is that it gives you more time to hang out with the characters of Homestuck, who were already very interesting and compelling, and who got comparatively less time for growth and development towards the end of the comic. It's cool to spend a little bit of time with favorite characters.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/pesterquest-rose-gameplay-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/pesterquest-rose-gameplay-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/pesterquest-rose-gameplay-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/pesterquest-rose-gameplay-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/pesterquest-rose-gameplay-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/pesterquest-rose-gameplay-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/pesterquest-rose-gameplay-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>The less obvious benefit to this arrangement is getting to see Homestuck as written by writers that aren't Andrew Hussie, the main author of Homestuck. Over time, Homestuck has become improved by its fans and collaborators, and it's nice to see the more mundane aspects of their lives fleshed out by fans who have thought about this sort of thing, and who have probably seen themselves in these characters. Here we get to explore Rose's gay fanfic writing, and Vriska's excitement for roleplay.<br><br>There's not a lot to Pesterquest; each character's miniquest takes less than an hour to complete, and there's just a few of them. But these are characters that are worth returning to, and I'm hoping to finish the game in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>5) Wildfire</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/Wildfire-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Wildfire-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Wildfire-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Wildfire-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Wildfire-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Wildfire-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Wildfire-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Now we get to the part of the list with all the games with beautiful pixel art.

After investigating a meteorite, you gain the ability to control the elements, starting with the power to control fire. But since the enemy warriors who destroyed your village have pointy swords and you do not, the game is mostly focused on stealth and puzzle solving.<br><br>The visual style of this game really strongly reminds me of a flash-based exploration game I played years ago called Knytt. It's basic, but carefully designed. And Wildfire is a lush mix of subtle pixel art and beautifully painted backgrounds. I'm super into it, and I enjoyed the level-based gameplay quite a lot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold); font-size: 18.4px;\">6) Ageless</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/Ageless-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Ageless-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Ageless-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Ageless-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Ageless-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Ageless-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Ageless-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Ageless is a Celeste rip-off.

Pull up some footage of Celeste and compare them side by side, it's very similar.</p>\n<p>Second is the story. Ageless stars a woman protagonist with self-loathing issues; the narrative is doled out gradually as she meets various other characters, and some of the obstacles around her are meant to reflect her mental state. That entire sentence could also be used to describe Celeste.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with making a rip-off, and Ageless is genuinely entertaining. But Ageless misses a few things that Celeste has. There's a general lack of production polish that cheapens the experience a bit. Also, Celeste told a sweet and subtle story over a long period of time, but Ageless is pretty obvious about telegraphing its main arc pretty much immediately. <br><br>And most importantly, Ageless isn't that hard. Celeste was brutally difficult, and incorporated that (and its extensive accessibility features) into the story in interesting ways. Celeste was more than the sum of its parts because it all came together to create a unique experience, whereas Ageless doesn't have that degree of self-control. It's still pretty fun, but it's no Celeste.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>7) Kingdom: Two Crowns</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/Kingdom-Two-Crowns-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Kingdom-Two-Crowns-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Kingdom-Two-Crowns-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Kingdom-Two-Crowns-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Kingdom-Two-Crowns-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Kingdom-Two-Crowns-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Kingdom-Two-Crowns-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Holy crap this game is pretty.

It's okay.<br><br>Kingdom: Two Crowns is (despite the number in the title) the THIRD game in the Kingdom series. Two Crowns is a base management game in which you (the realm's king or queen) have a huge jar of coins, and you use it to fund the defense and slow expansion of your realm. Exploring and giving out coins are pretty much your only means of interacting with the world, so you're dependent on your kingdom to defend you. It's a pretty neat idea for a game, and a good method of interaction with a pixel-based world.<br><br>Maybe I'm just impatient, but I ran out of coins fast, and then I had not a lot to do.

I've seen versions of this mechanic in other puzzle games, but since different characters have different abilities here, you do have to strategize who you send to do what jobs, so you can get to the end.<br><br>There's time limits for bronze, silver, and gold medals, and the game isn't very long, so it feels pretty manageable.

I went and looked at gameplay footage of the game on 3DS, and it fits the smaller screen much better.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/Shantae-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Shantae-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Shantae-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Shantae-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Shantae-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Shantae-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Shantae-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Never mind, because regardless, Shantae is a gorgeous game.

You have a group of heroes who go up against a villain, and both you and them play cards at each other until somebody wins and somebody loses.

There's a lot of elements that add variety and interest: two-stage villains, environmental hazards, and so on. I'm generally a huge sucker for superhero media, and on a pretty basic level this worked for me.<br><br>Biggest downside that I could find is the game's flavor. The heroes and villains are extremely boringly designed. Characters like Bunker (a big robot guy), Legacy (a Captain America-esque dude), Wraith (stealth ninja), and Tachyon (speedy girl) are pretty forgettable; I had to look all of those names up.<br><br>Moreover, this game needs some serious polish. If you attack the villain with a long-range weapon, you get the same gunshot effect, regardless of whether you're attacking with a pistol, a shotgun, or even a non-gun weapon like a shuriken. The game's core is decent, and I liked playing with it, but it would need some work for me to consider it good.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>4) Switchcars</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/Switchcars-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Switchcars-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Switchcars-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Switchcars-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Switchcars-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Switchcars-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/17/responsive/Switchcars-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Switchcars is a weird little game.

(Disney Animation had a similar period from 2008 to 2016, and Marvel and Star Wars have now been in that position for several years.) In the early 2010s, Pixar lost that must-see status, plagued by too many sequels (Cars 2, Monsters University) and poor quality original films (Brave, The Good Dinosaur).<br><br>Putting Pixar's films on Disney+ for no additional charge is honestly a pretty good idea. This'll get more eyes on Pixar's newest films, which seem to be a return to form for the company. Their upcoming summer project, Luca, looks good, and their latest offering from last Christmas, Soul, is very good.<br><br>Soul is a movie about Joe Gardner (played by Jamie Foxx), a young black music teacher with ambitions to be in a band. On the day he gets his first big break, he dies suddenly, but he refuses to go quietly into the afterlife. Instead, he embarks on a quest to return to his old body and life, accompanied by Soul 22 (played by Tina Fey).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Soul-image-jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Soul-image-jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Soul-image-jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Soul-image-jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Soul-image-jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Soul-image-jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Soul-image-jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1145\" height=\"472\"></figure><br>Soul did not quite grab me at first. Joe firmly believes that he died before he was able to fulfill his life's purpose, and the afterlife does nothing to disabuse him of that notion. He learns that new souls must find their \"spark\" before they are able to embark on the journey of life; since 22's never found their spark, they've never lived. So Joe, believing that nothing is more important than fulfilling his destiny, works to restore his life at any cost.<br><br>But while 22 is helping Joe out, they begin to experience the possibilities of life in a far more tangible way than they ever have before. And this is where Soul shines, and why it had me in tears by the end. Despite its premise, Soul celebrates the mere act of living, and the wondrousness of life's experiences, even if they're as simple as eating a slice of pizza, or watching a leaf float to the ground.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Parasite</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Parasite-title-jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-title-jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-title-jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-title-jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-title-jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-title-jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-title-jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1033\" height=\"426\"></figure>\n<p>I'm impressed that this film got made. I'm even more impressed that it received the accolades it did in the US. Parasite is the first-ever foreign film to win the Oscar for Best Picture, and yet it's a brutal story about classism that's deeply anti-capitalist. It's not the sort of cutting critique that I usually expect to see getting accolades by Hollywood. My best guess is that the Korean setting gave the Academy enough remove from the story to not see it as a critique of the system it's a part of.<br><br>The film follows a poor Korean family living in the slums. They suddenly get a break when a family friend invites the son to be an English tutor for a rich family. The boy acquires another tutoring job from the same family for his sister, and together they get chauffeur and housemaid jobs for their parents, resorting to increasingly unethical measures to bring the whole family in on the scam.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Parasite-image-jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-image-jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-image-jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-image-jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-image-jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-image-jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Parasite-image-jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1147\" height=\"469\"></figure><br>Bong Joon-Ho has made some sensational genre films over the course of his career, including the apocalyptic Snowpiercer, and the monster movies Okja and The Host.

It has some iconic moments, especially a rainstorm sequence which displaces the poor family from their home, but which serves as a pleasant experience for the rich family.<br><br>I couldn't actually finish the film, because the climactic sequence gets a bit too gory for me to stomach. But the parts of the film I saw were thought-provoking and very funny. I'd call it one of the must-see films of the past couple years; it's only gotten more relevant with time and a global pandemic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Ready Player One</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Ready-Player-One-title-jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-title-jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-title-jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-title-jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-title-jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-title-jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-title-jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1147\" height=\"360\"></figure>\n<p>I've been unsure for years whether or not to watch this film. I read the book years ago, and found it underwhelming, and it's aged very poorly since then. The reports I heard when the movie came out was that it was a visually spectacular adventure, but 2018 was a pretty packed year for blockbuster movies, so I missed it. Now I've finally watched it, and I'm glad I did, because Ready Player One was more thought-provoking than I expected, both in how it's similar to the book, and how it's different.<br><br>So first of all, the story still has a lot of the same fundamental problems it did in the book. Main character Wade Watts is a gamer in the popular virtual reality world OASIS, and he's part of a global treasure hunt inside the game that will lead the winner to the game designer's fortune, along with the game's ownership rights. The protagonists are a scrappy group of nerds, and the antagonists are a large corporation that wants to win the rights to the game for themselves, so they can turn the game into an empty corporate product. There's nothing wrong with that duality in theory, but OASIS is already a very corporate thing, so it's weird seeing the story be so selective about which corporations are good.<br><br>Also, and this should be pretty obvious with such a whitebread dude protagonist nerd story, but the treatment of the minorities in the film (ladies &amp; people of color) is not good. It bothered me when I first read the book, but it bothers me even more now. And there's this obsession in Ready Player One with figuring out who somebody \"really is\" behind their player avatar. In 2021, that obsession seems immature and out-of-touch. When Wade finds out that his best friend, a large orc dude, is actually a pint-sized black woman, it's treated as a huge twist. But why should it be? If his friend feels more comfortable presenting differently online from their IRL self, why should that be frowned upon? Certainly that's incredibly common in my (mostly trans) social circles.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Ready-Player-One-image-jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-image-jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-image-jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-image-jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-image-jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-image-jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Ready-Player-One-image-jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1145\" height=\"463\"></figure><br>But all of those are the problems the film retains by translating the book's story pretty faithfully to the screen. What's more fascinating to me is how and why the film is better than the book.<br><br>Wade's inner monologue is almost entirely gone. That's a huge positive already; in the book it makes him even more of a whiny entitled know-it-all. The book also reveled in its pop culture references, shining a light on how many references it knew, and how cool the protagonist (and author) were for knowing them. In a visual media, those references are largely relegated to background details, which streamlines and spotlights the story, making the references more of a fun flavor to the film than the focus. In such a position, these references doubly serve as neat Easter eggs for the audience to spot, and also a way of establishing this world as one where people customize themselves and their identities partly around the stories they've loved.<br><br>That ties into the most interesting part of this movie: its depiction of a virtual world as a cultural amalgamation. I can't really think of a mainstream videogame that does this. MMOs like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV and Second Life all have various restrictions, but Ready Player One's OASIS has much fewer. Of course people in a virtual world would want to try being Tracer from Overwatch, or a cat person, or a giant robot. And while this vision is enabled by Warner Bros.' hoarding of creative property (also on display in The Lego Movies and the upcoming Space Jam 2), it is heartening to see a world I'd love to see, in which everybody has the freedom to shape their image and identity as freely as they desire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>TV</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Space Force</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Space-Force-title-jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-title-jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-title-jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-title-jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-title-jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-title-jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-title-jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1676\" height=\"754\"></figure>\n<p>I really needed some light comedy sci-fi television to get thru the second half of February, and both this and the next show on this list surprised me with how good they are.<br><br>Space Force is probably the only way I can see humor about the Trump administration really ever working. The humor of The Daily Show from the Bush era really backfired during the Trump administration, because while that humor felt like cutting insights into the greed and corruption behind politics and the media in the 2000s, Trump used those ideas to his advantage to do horrible things for four years. It was really really hard to be funny about that, and I think a lot of comedy institutions suffered for it, or moved away from politics entirely.<br><br>Space Force is a story about General Mark Naird (played by Steve Carrell), an air force general who's recruited to be the new head of Trump's new branch of the military: the Space Force. (Yes, this is a real thing.) As Space Force attempts to get a military presence in space, and ultimately on the moon, the show uses the tried-and-true comedy technique of Murphy's Law: everything that can go wrong, does.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Space-Force-image-jpg-2.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-image-jpg-2-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-image-jpg-2-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-image-jpg-2-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-image-jpg-2-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-image-jpg-2-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Space-Force-image-jpg-2-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1133\" height=\"510\"></figure><br>I was not encouraged by the premise of the show, which was to make fun of one of Trump's many heinous and wasteful acts as president. A couple things about this show make it actually work pretty well. The first thing is that Space Force as a concept is more ridiculous than actively harmful, and everybody (especially Naird) seems to be aware of that to some degree. <br><br>The real thing that makes the show work is that it's ultimately about a group of people who are trying to do their best under ridiculous circumstances. There's two hearts to the show: Naird's relationship with his family, which he tries valiantly to save even as it falls apart in various ways, and Naird's relationship with his chief scientist Dr. Adrian Mallory, played by John Malkovich. Mallory (along with other minor characters in the show) balks at the idea of the militarization of space, but also revels in the idea at being given actual funding for space exploration. His push-and-pull relationship with Naird, in which they alternately respect and distrust each other, provides the drama for many of the show's strongest episodes.<br><br>Showrunners Greg Daniels and Steve Carrell are most notable for their work on The Office in the 2000s. But there's been a shift in the comedy scene in the last decade, one that the Office creative heads have rolled with, which I really appreciate. The Office may have been the most popular sitcom of its time, but by the time Parks &amp; Rec aired in 2009, cringe comedy was already on the way out. The Office creators have increased the level of earnestness, optimism, and humanity in every one of their projects since then, including later seasons of Parks &amp; Rec, Brooklyn 99, and The Good Place. Space Force continues that trend, keeping its story relevant and heartwarming, and still managing to be deeply funny.

It's a pretty good show.<br><br>Resident Alien is a Syfy show about an alien, played by genre veteran Alan Tudyk, who crashlands on Earth. The alien kills and steals the body of a human, and pretends to be the human in order to get around the local town, Men in Black style. While the alien attempts to salvage his ship and continue his intended mission of destroying the Earth, he gets mistaken for the town's new doctor and roped into their search for a potential serial killer.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Resident-Alien-image-jpg.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Resident-Alien-image-jpg-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Resident-Alien-image-jpg-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Resident-Alien-image-jpg-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Resident-Alien-image-jpg-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Resident-Alien-image-jpg-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Resident-Alien-image-jpg-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1117\" height=\"625\"></figure><br>The show's a bit unfocused, and there's a few too many subplots, but I wanted to bring it up because it's one of the best depictions of an autistically-coded main character I've seen in mainstream television. Too many autistic characters are treated in the same stereotypical way: cold aloof geniuses with no emotional intelligence. Yet they remain successful because they're what the audience expects, and so shows like The Good Doctor and Young Sheldon get renewed for more and more seasons. <br><br>But by merely having a main character who doesn't quite see the world in the same way most humans do, but is trying quite hard to understand it, Resident Alien is truer to the autistic experience than many shows I've seen with more explicit intentions as such. It's far from perfect, but it's fascinating how in *not* trying to make this show about neurodivergence, Resident Alien has succeeded so well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>WandaVision</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Wandavision-titles-compilation-jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Wandavision-titles-compilation-jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Wandavision-titles-compilation-jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Wandavision-titles-compilation-jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Wandavision-titles-compilation-jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Wandavision-titles-compilation-jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Wandavision-titles-compilation-jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2492\" height=\"1086\"></figure>\n<p>Bravo to Marvel Studios and the entire team behind this show. WandaVision is a phenomenal thing, and is one of my favorite projects in the entire MCU.<br><br>I wrote about the first half of this show in my last \"best of the month\" post for January 2021, and the biggest thing I want to emphasize here is how well they stuck the landing. WandaVision's second half includes even more Easter eggs, subplots, red herrings, and teases of future projects, to the degree that it could have gotten unwieldy -- and yet it still manages to tell a smart and tightly-written story that's ultimately about Wanda Maximoff's grief and loss, and how she copes with it.<br><br>The closer the show gets to its conclusion, the more that the cracks that appeared in the facade in the show's first half become actual rifts.

Fans were divided; I loved it. Firstly cause it's fun as heck, and I'm a sucker for cool superhero fights. But also, it felt like the show positioned the MCU, in its quippiness and its soap opera drama and its dozens of characters moving easily from franchise to franchise, as a (potential) next logical step in the growth of the sitcom.<br><br>By the time the show finishes, several further Marvel projects have been set up. Monica Rambeau got an awesome superhero origin story in the margins of this show, and she'll be featured in the next Captain Marvel movie. Wanda's discovered new powers that will bring her to Doctor Strange in his next film. And there's hints towards an as-yet-unannounced Young Avengers project, too. But I'll remember WandaVision fondly as a show that, rarely for this genre, *did* deliver on the insane hype from week to week, and told a satisfying and cathartic story about grief, love, and trauma.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>The Falcon &amp; the Winter Soldier</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-title-jpg.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-title-jpg-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-title-jpg-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-title-jpg-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-title-jpg-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-title-jpg-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-title-jpg-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1131\" height=\"504\"></figure>\n<p>It's a really good thing that Marvel changed their plans and aired WandaVision before Falcon &amp; Winter Soldier, because the two shows really don't compare favorably in terms of quality.<br><br>F&amp;WS focuses on fan-favorite Captain America supporting cast members Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes, in the immediate aftermath of a major plot cliffhanger from Avengers: Endgame. Having decided to retire, Steve Rogers has given Sam Wilson the Captain America shield, bequeathing the heroic identity to one of his best friends.<br><br>Sam, however, doesn't think that the world needs a Captain America anymore, and donates the shield to the Smithsonian. Steve's other best friend, Bucky, gets very pissed about this, especially when the US government decides, \"no actually we do want a Captain America, we're going to give it to our most decorated soldier, John Walker.\" When Bucky goes to confront Sam, he's roped into Sam's current mission: tracking down a group of anarchists named the Flag-Smashers that seem to have gotten access to super-soldier technology.<br><br>Once they're hanging out together, Sam's and Bucky's chemistry is actually really really good. It annoyed me in the trailers, but in context it works a lot better. Bucky's constantly pissed off, which fuels a lot of the banter, but it's for the pretty understandable reason that he thinks Sam disrespected his childhood friend by giving up the shield. The two are fun in action scenes together, and even the actor playing John Walker is giving it 100%, perfectly riding the line between kinda likeable and kinda a complete jerk.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-image-jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-image-jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-image-jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-image-jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-image-jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-image-jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Falcon-Winter-Soldier-image-jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1721\" height=\"695\"></figure><br>But I have so many issues with this show. It raises so many questions. Okay, so the Flag-Smashers are a group of people who aren't pleased with how many resources are being given to the 4 billion people who have suddenly re-appeared on Earth after the events of Endgame, and who are now refugees. Answer me this: why is the group who are anti-refugees also anti-borders? Surely they'd want *more* borders in order to restrict movement of goods, services, and people, so that they don't lose the resources they have?<br><br>The answer of course, is that it's another example of Marvel creating a villain with both left-leaning and right-leaning politics smashed into one, so that everybody watching has a reason to sympathize with and dislike the villains. It may be good business sense, but it doesn't hold up to much narrative scrutiny.<br><br>Here's my other issue: when Steve Rogers was hired to be Captain America, he was initially used by the US government as a propaganda machine to help finance WWII. It kind of *is* the government's right to make a new Captain America out of whoever they want, especially if the original guy isn't around anymore, and they got the shield back in their possession. Has the mantle come to mean more than that? Steve certainly seemed to think so, given his actions in The First Avenger, and I bet that's part of what F&amp;WS will grapple with in the second half of its run. But the approach of hiring John Walker isn't a totally and innately invalid one, either.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Otherside Picnic</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Otherside-Picnic-title-jpg.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Otherside-Picnic-title-jpg-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Otherside-Picnic-title-jpg-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Otherside-Picnic-title-jpg-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Otherside-Picnic-title-jpg-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Otherside-Picnic-title-jpg-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Otherside-Picnic-title-jpg-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1296\" height=\"725\"></figure>\n<p>If there's one show that I really want to recommend more than any other this month, it's Otherside Picnic.

Sometimes it's just cool to see a representation of yourself in media. I like that the protagonist is a tomboy with great hoodie style and heterochromia in her eyes.

After immersing myself in Love Chuunibyo &amp; Other Delusions, which posited that an imagined magical world can actually be beneficial to your mental health, it was neat to see a show that builds on those ideas by saying this: \"the adventures that magic may take you on can be scary, but it might also bring you closer to the people you love.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>GAMES</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Hitman 3</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Hitman-3-title-jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-title-jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-title-jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-title-jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-title-jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-title-jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-title-jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></figure>\n<p>I am agog at this game. I am astounded at the beauty and craftsmanship and fun that's been crammed into every nook and cranny of Hitman 3. What an amazing game this is.<br><br>In January, I played all the levels of Hitman 1 and 2, most of them for the first time. They are incredibly good games with incredibly good levels. But Hitman 3 raises the bar even higher.<br><br>The first level of the game, set in a Dubai skyscraper, is a riff on a Mission Impossible sequence, perhaps the one from MI4 that was also set in a Dubai skyscraper. The second level of the game contains a murder mystery in an old Agatha Christie-style mansion, similar to the premise of Knives Out. The third level of the game is a dark thriller in which 47 has few resources and no guidance on who his targets are. The fourth level is an epic sprawling level that takes place in the neon-lit and rainy streets of China, ending in a huge underground lab. The fifth level is the most old-school Hitman the game gets; it's a pretty straightforward level in a winery, with a couple of neat twists that keeps the story exciting. And the sixth level is a linear level on a train that is nonetheless extremely fun.<br><br>The whole experience is breathtaking. The variety on display, the craft of the game design, and the evolution of the art style are all incredible. The narrative more directly informs the mission styles in this game than in the previous two installments, which means there's refreshing variety to the gameplay style. And of course every level looks tremendous. My jaw dropped when I emerged onto the streets of Chongqing.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Hitman-3-image-jpg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-image-jpg-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-image-jpg-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-image-jpg-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-image-jpg-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-image-jpg-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Hitman-3-image-jpg-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><br>I also don't want to understate the quality of Hitman 2's DLC levels, which I also played recently.

That helps a lot with the tricky jumps and courses that appear in the game's post-credits levels, and it's allowed me to play thru those endgame levels for the first time.<br><br>I'm just a couple challenges away from finishing every level in the game, and I've barely played Bowser's Fury, so I expect to still get quite a lot of enjoyment out of this. Super Mario 3D World on Switch is just as fun as it was last year on Wii U, and maybe even more so.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>YOUTUBE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Defunctland</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/Defunctland-title-jpg.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Defunctland-title-jpg-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Defunctland-title-jpg-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Defunctland-title-jpg-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Defunctland-title-jpg-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Defunctland-title-jpg-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/16/responsive/Defunctland-title-jpg-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1145\" height=\"647\"></figure>\n<p>And finally, a shout-out to Defunctland, a Youtube series I've been enjoying a lot recently. Defunctland is a show that explores the history of amusement parks, thru concepts and rides and even entire parks that have since been shut down.<br><br>I love amusement parks in general, so I was always going to love this show. But I'm continually impressed at the production quality, how in-depth the research is, and how much archival footage Kevin Perjurer is able to dig up.<br><br>Season 2 focuses on Michael Eisner's tenure as CEO of Disney, and season 3 focuses on the early days of the Disney parks. In both cases, I have been continually surprised and intrigued by the naked celebration of capitalism on display in the parks and in the company. From the rampant sponsorships of early Disney rides, to Eisner's constant attempts at starting new products for a quick profit, both seasons have put a spotlight on Disney prioritizing profit over story in a way that seems to have been disguised better in recent years.<br><br>There's also DefuncTV, which focuses on cancelled shows, including a six-part miniseries on the work of Jim Henson. I feel like Defunctland has gotten very popular recently, but in case you've never heard of it, I highly recommend giving it a shot.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-left\">I'm kind of astonished that a publication like Weekly Shonen Jump exists. Jump is a weekly magazine, with each issue containing the latest chapters in about 20 ongoing serialized manga series. Jump series are primarily action-adventure, which is an incredibly popular genre. In that sense, it's not too surprisingly that Jump is consistently the best-selling manga magazine in Japan.<br><br>What is surprising, and somewhat subversive, is the ethos of Jump. At its core, an enduring Jump series has to have a lot of heart. Jump does sometimes publish rote action series that are nothing but empty spectacle, but those series don't tend to endure, and are often cancelled quickly. If you want your Jump series to survive, a focus on love and friendship is essential.<br><br>Jump's weekly release schedule can be grueling to the writers and artists working on them, and that shouldn't be understated: another core pillar of the global entertainment industry built on the backs of capitalistic exploitation. Still, I'm heartened by the amount of hope, optimism, and love present in some of these series. The best ones come from a really special place, and affect me pretty deeply.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>HOW DID WE GET HERE?</strong></p>\n<p>Viz Media, the US manga publisher that has the stateside rights to Jump series, has tried to bring Jump to the US in different ways over the years. Many of the more popular series, like One Piece and Dragon Ball, find their way to the US via localized anime adaptations and several-hundred-page chapter collections. <br><br>The actual weekly publication, Weekly Shonen Jump, has appeared in English in a few forms. An altered version that mixed older and newer series received a monthly release in comic book stores, to share the shelves with characters like Spider-Man and Superman. As online media distribution rose to prominence in the 2010s, Viz instead attempted an online subscription to a digital version of the complete magazine.<br><br>Finally, in 2019, Viz cut out the middleman, and put up a huge archive of dozens of Jump series, updating each week with the newest chapters from Weekly Shonen Jump, along with other magazines like Jump Square, V Jump, and some online-exclusive series from Jump Plus. New chapters are free, and the archive is a couple bucks a month. It's an astonishingly good deal and a great system for catching up with old series. <br><br>Last spring, I learned about this archive and its low price, and I've been trying valiantly to catch up with the 20-ish series running in the weekly magazine ever since. I'm not quite done; Weekly Shonen Jump currently has five heavy-hitters that have each run for over a hundred chapters each, and I haven't finished any of them yet. These five are Jujutsu Kaisen (144 chapters), Dr. Stone (190 chapters), Black Clover (287 chapters), My Hero Academia (307 chapters), and One Piece (1008 chapters). <br><br>Each of these five series is very popular, in part because of successful anime adaptations that have received passionate fanbases and widespread critical acclaim. If you're tied into the manga/anime scene, you probably know at least a couple of those names.<br><br>But there's more to Jump than the big guns. What excites me just as much, if not more, is the newer series, some of which never make it past 100 or even 50 chapters. Their quality varies widely, but I think they all deserve a chance in the spotlight, because all of them are interesting.<br><br>So here we go: even though I haven't completely caught up with all 20 currently-running Weekly Shonen Jump series, I'm caught up with all 15 series that are under a hundred chapters as of the end of March 2021. And I'd like to do a quick rundown of where Jump is at right now. There's some pretty good stuff here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>NINE DRAGONS' BALL PARADE</strong><br><strong>7 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED FEBRUARY 2021</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>It's pretty normal for Jump to have at least one sports manga running at any given time. The basketball manga Slam Dunk ran during the 90s, and subsequently appeared in the US localization of Jump in the 2000s. More recently, volleyball manga Haikyu enjoyed a long and successful run thru the 2010s, and a similarly succesful anime adaptation. <br><br>Haikyu was one of many series to end last year; 2020 saw an unusually large amount of turnover for Jump, making the number of current Jump series under 100 chapters unusually high. Here, about a year later, is a replacement: Nine Dragons' Ball Parade, a new baseball manga.<br><br>NDBP is Jump's most recent addition, the last of four new series that debuted at the beginning of 2021. It follows the adventures of a young catcher and pitcher as they follow their dreams to slowly build their own baseball team. The series has only been out a couple of months, and I kind of keep forgetting just how good it is from week to week. <br><br>The plot structure necessitates a very slow introduction of characters, so there's plenty of time to get to know each one as the series progresses. It reminds me a bit of One Piece's slow and methodical approach to building its main cast in Luffy's pirate crew. We've only got four main cast members so far, but I'm excited to see where the series goes with them, especially once they start getting into actual baseball games.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>WITCH WATCH</strong><br><strong>8 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED FEBRUARY 2021</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/02-Witch-Watch.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>Jump series are mostly categorized into two broad categories: series centered heavily around a serialized plot, with each chapter adding to a greater whole; and series that are mostly one-off stories, often focused on comedy, called \"gag manga.\" For instance, Witch Watch is straight-up a fantasy slice-of-life gag manga, and it's fantastic.<br><br>Witch Watch, by veteran mangaka Kenta Shinohara, follows a young witch named Nico and her ogre childhood best friend, Mori. When Mori learns that doom may soon befall the witch, he agrees to protect her as her personal bodyguard.<br><br>With stories about young witches, I generally expect the witch to be underpowered as she learns how to use her magic, such as in Kiki's Delivery Service or Little Witch Academia. In Witch Watch, Nico has no such handicap. She begins the story with extraordinary abilities, and performs a new unusual spell about once per chapter. This leads to some visually impressive sequences.<br><br>The story still has drama, though, because Nico has no idea how to interact with people, even though she badly wants to make friends and help as many people as possible. This openhearted and extroverted nature often clashes with Mori's overprotectiveness, which is the heart of the series' drama.<br><br>Right now, this is the series that excites me the most from week to week. It's fun, it's creative, and it's expertly drawn. Only two months in, and I'm totally on board with this one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>I TELL C</strong><br><strong>9 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED FEBRUARY 2021</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/03-i-tell-c.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>i tell c is a mystery series, written and drawn by Kazusa Inaoka, who has contributed two short series to Jump in the last few years. It stars three detectives who go after serial killers together. Two of them are twin brothers, each with a different approach to solving crime. The third is a young woman who falls in love with the criminal of every case, and uses her considerable deductive powers to determine the criminal's identity so that she can date him. The two twin detectives tend to solve each case by following the young woman as she goes off on her own to find and profess her love to the criminal.<br><br>I really can't get a bead on this series yet. After a few chapters that felt relatively formulaic, the series kicked its plot into high gear and had a few chapters of serious consequence to the status quo. Since then, it's seemed to settle back into a new routine. The premise is definitely strange, and I'm not sure it's in a way that I like. But the art is good, and I end up caring about the woman detective more as her backstory is revealed, so... fingers crossed on this one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>THE ELUSIVE SAMURAI</strong><br><strong>10 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JANUARY 2021</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/04-The-Elusive-Samurai.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>This was the first new series to debut in 2021, and as a result it's the one that's settled the most into a routine from week to week. But it's still really really solid.<br><br>Yusei Matsui, who previously wrote a hugely popular series during the 2010s called Assassination Classroom, here tells the story of Hojo Tokiyuki, a young boy prince who just barely escapes his family's slaughter in the 1333 Siege of Kamakura. He's protected by Suwa Yorishige, a father figure with strange and prophetic visions of the future. Suwa takes Hojo under his wing in order to help train him, and gather an army to take back his homeland.<br><br>This is sort of a strange idea for a series on its face, especially if you know how the story ended in real life. (It's not a particularly shonen-friendly happy ending.) Even the manga itself admits in its narration that the characters are barely a footnote in historical texts.<br><br>But on a structural level, this is genius. It's the similar sort of training setup, along with slowly getting to know a steadily growing cast of characters, that you expect to see in battle manga like Naruto or Dragon Ball. </p>\n<p>And the characters themselves are fun. Suwa gets a bit grating at times; his visions frequently prophesize Shonen Jump itself, which is... a bit much. But the young Hojo is a totally charming character. His whole gimmick is that he's better at running away from things than anybody else, and Suwa decides to lean on that strength in his training. It's an unusual take, in a genre that valorizes courage, to celebrate the act of fleeing as a positive character trait and a valuable tactical strategy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>SAKAMOTO DAYS</strong><br><strong>17 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED NOVEMBER 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/05-Sakamoto-Days.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>Sakamoto Days is a series about an old and mute hitman named Sakamoto, who decides to retire from the assassination business to run a convenience store with his wife and daughter. The plot begins when people from his old life (first allies, and then enemies) begin to trickle back into his new life, and the series' drama revolves not only around whether he'll be able to protect his family, but also whether he'll be able to shield them from the potential psychological damage of being targeted by assassins.<br><br>Sakamoto Days is mostly (at first) a comedy manga, especially in its setup. The viewpoint character is Shin, an ally of Sakamoto's who's also a clairvoyant, so he can hear Sakamoto's thoughts and communicate with him telepathically. Sakamoto himself is a tubby dude, but he gets into action scenes with the vigor of a young man.<br><br>But it's the best type of comedy manga, because it's one that has serious drama for its characters. The stakes are high, but they're also hilarious; in one sequence, the wife and daughter decide to visit a haunted house at a funfair, and Sakamoto and Shin must protect them from assassins in a way that convinces them that the assassins are just part of the attraction.<br><br>As time has gone on, Sakamoto Days has shifted gradually to a more serialized plot, which is actually a shame; there's not much to the plot, but its one-and-done comedy ideas from week to week tend to be a lot of fun.

From the exaggerated art style, to the reckless optimism of its protagonist (who wants to be King, in this case of the builders rather than the pirates), even down to the specific way the protagonist's ranged attack is drawn, this is a series that saw One Piece about to pass its 1000 chapter mark and thought, how hard can it be?<br><br>Of course, something as monstrously popular as One Piece is extremely difficult to copy, and Build King definitely fails at it, and generally fails at being an entertaining series at all. But it's certainly a fascinating one. Our heroes are Tonkachi and Renga, two brothers who grew up on a desert island and learned how to build impressive dwellings for its animal inhabitants. Or rather, one of them learned how. Renga is a decent architect, but Tonkachi's enthusiasm often gets the better of him, and he'd much rather have fun smashing things with his hammer.<br><br>Both boys want to be master builders in a society that highly values architects that can do impossible things, and so the story follows them in their quest to become great architects. Along the way they encounter living house-beasts, a tournament designed to qualify builders with licenses, and dwellings that seem to be built impossibly.<br><br>There's some unique visuals in this series, and I'm particularly intrigued by the overly elaborate drawing style of the characters. It's a look that reminds me a bit of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, and it's clearly worked out well for the mangaka, who worked previously on a Jump series about a gourmet cook that ran in the magazine for nearly a decade in the 2010s. But this particular story really isn't doing it for me, and it's frequently my least favorite Jump series, except for weeks when Hard-Boiled Cop &amp; Dolphin is having a particularly incompetent week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>PHANTOM SEER</strong><br><strong>29 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED AUGUST 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/07-Phantom-Seer.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/07-Phantom-Seer-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/07-Phantom-Seer-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/07-Phantom-Seer-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/07-Phantom-Seer-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/07-Phantom-Seer-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/07-Phantom-Seer-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>I can forgive a series a lot of flaws if it has some interesting ideas that are well-executed. Phantom Seer doesn't have the most compelling of plots, exactly. Riku is a normal high school girl who meets Iori, a fellow student who exorcises spirits. The problem is, he'd rather just be a normal person. Thru their adventures together, Riku learns about her own supernatural powers as a Beckoning Hand, and Iori slowly learns to care about things again.<br><br>\"Plucky girl and stubborn dude\" is an extremely common duo in anime and manga. You can see it everywhere from Witch Watch in Jump, to the light novel series Haruhi Suzumiya. There's nothing wrong with using a well-established trope, but I think Phantom Seer's biggest flaw is the aimlessness of Iori's desires. If you compare this to Undead Unluck later on, which has a main character whose goal is to die, Iori doesn't really do much work to reach his goal. He just enters every action scene with a resigned tone, like he's saying \"mom, do I HAVE to?\"<br><br>But Phantom Seer is selling very well, and I'm not surprised. On a micro level, I think this series works great. There's a fun sequence that takes place within a mirror funhouse. There's a story arc where an old friend of Iori's shows up, and begins transforming into a half-phantom hybrid. The most recent storyline involves a villain who turns everybody into dolls. The concepts are a great mix of creepy and cool, and the art style emphasizes their grotesqueness beautifully.<br><br>Phantom Seer is created by a team of two: Togo Goto, who's writing his first Jump manga here, and Kento Matsuura, who previously illustrated Tokyo Shinobi Squad in Jump in 2019. At time of writing, Jump has announced the impending cancellation of Phantom Seer. I was disappointed at first, but I think Jump may have seen the fact that this series doesn't really work at its core on a long-term basis. I do hope to see these two working on another project in the future, because this has been a delight to read from week to week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>HIGH SCHOOL FAMILY</strong><br><strong>32 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED SEPTEMBER 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/08-High-School-Family.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/08-High-School-Family-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/08-High-School-Family-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/08-High-School-Family-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/08-High-School-Family-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/08-High-School-Family-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/08-High-School-Family-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>Jump debuted a huge number of comedy manga last year. Some of them have since been cancelled, but many haven't. It felt overwhelming in 2020; now, the balance is a bit better. <br><br>I'll be honest, I don't really read Jump for the comedy series, so I didn't really care for most of the new comedy series that debuted last year, with a few exceptions. But all the ones that have stuck around have grown on me a little, including High School Family.<br><br>High School Family has a really simple premise: a boy goes to high school for the first time, and to his dismay, he's joined by his little sister, and their mother and father, and their cat. That's the sort of goofy premise where the jokes basically write themselves; the younger sister becomes the class' precocious genius, the mother bakes for everybody, the cat becomes the class mascot, and so on.<br><br>The boy, who's the only character who's the correct age (and species) for high school, is pretty understandably put off by all of this. But the more the series has gradually shifted focus away from him, the better it's gotten. Because at its heart, High School Family is a fish out of water story about a group of people in a situation they're not really prepared for. The more the story focuses on their struggles and their earnest attempts to fit in, the more the story's heart shines through.<br><br>The best character is easily the father. We get the most information on his backstory: he was part of a successful business and was all set up for a promotion, but decided to leave his job in order to fulfill his dream of attending high school. He gets the most characters from his past filtering back into the story, and he gets the most compelling arcs, such as when he tries out for the volleyball team but ends up becoming the team's errand boy.<br><br>It's not an amazing series, but as a comedy filler between the magazine's bigger series, it now fits perfectly, because it's not just cringe comedy anymore. It's an earnest story with heart and love, even if it's a weird one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>ME &amp; ROBOCO</strong><br><strong>35 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JULY 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/09-Me-and-Roboco.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/09-Me-and-Roboco-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/09-Me-and-Roboco-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/09-Me-and-Roboco-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/09-Me-and-Roboco-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/09-Me-and-Roboco-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/09-Me-and-Roboco-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>Me &amp; Roboco is a comedy series about reading Shonen Jump. That seems obvious from its debut cover art, but it took me a while to figure out, and honestly I think it also took a while to crystalize in the plot. Going back to the earliest chapters, it took nearly a dozen chapters for Jump itself to start featuring heavily into the fabric of Me &amp; Roboco.<br><br>Me &amp; Roboco takes place an unknown period of time into the future in which everybody has their own robot maid. When kid protagonist Bondo's family finally gets one, the maid (named Roboco) is strangely different from everybody else's. She's differently shaped from other robot maids, and she seems to have no conception of how to do basic maid duties, like cooking a meal or cleaning a room.<br><br>Early on, the drama of each heavily gag-focused manga is about what you'd expect from that premise: where did Roboco come from, will she learn how to be a good maid, and will she and Bondo get along? There's a pretty solid supporting cast, including my favorite characters: a couple of bullies in Bondo's class who always turn their bullying around at the last moment into something super supportive. It's a really good joke every time.<br><br>As time goes on, we learn something really important about Bondo and his friendgroup: they're all huge fans of Shonen Jump. A lot of the jokes and plots in later chapters revolve around homages to classic and current Jump series. But the best chapters are about how Jump brings the friendgroup together in little ways, how the lessons of friendship inherent in most Jump series resonate out into the real world. For that reason, this is probably the most solid series Jump has that's purely comedy and has zero aspirations to be a serialized narrative. It fits the magazine perfectly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>HARD-BOILED COP &amp; DOLPHIN</strong><br><strong>36 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JUNE 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/10-Hard-Boiled-Cop-and-Dolphin.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/10-Hard-Boiled-Cop-and-Dolphin-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/10-Hard-Boiled-Cop-and-Dolphin-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/10-Hard-Boiled-Cop-and-Dolphin-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/10-Hard-Boiled-Cop-and-Dolphin-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/10-Hard-Boiled-Cop-and-Dolphin-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/10-Hard-Boiled-Cop-and-Dolphin-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>I already played my hand here earlier, but oh well: this series is a mess. Build King may be a ripoff, but I think this is my least favorite currently running Jump series both in conception and execution.<br><br>HBC&amp;D is about a cop named Boyle (cause he's hard-\"Boyle\"d, get it?) who's shipped off to a small island town as a punishment. His new partner is an anthropomorphic dolphin man named Orpheus, and Orpheus' young adoptive daughter Chako. Together, the three of them investigate crimes on the island, mostly perpetrated by other anthropomorphized sea creature immigrants from the surrounding waters (ugh), as well as a cult that lionizes the young Chako as their prophet, and keeps trying to kidnap her (also ugh).<br><br>Like, I dunno, I feel like just describing this manga's plot should be enough to explain why it's bad. It plays into the sorts of stereotypes that empower cops to commit horrible acts against citizens: all the criminals here are illegal immigrants and child-stealers. <br><br>At least with i tell c, another cop drama in Jump, the characters are less cop than they are detective, and there's a lot more empathy given to the criminals, and more shades of gray about the motives and methods of the police. Here, the conflicts are all very one-sided.<br><br>And it's not even GOOD copaganda! At least the most recent arc has devolved into a race for an ancient temple, like the series has turned into Indiana Jones. Most of the time, the writing is very boring and pedantic, there's way too much exposition, the characters are extremely unlikeable, and the art does not work. All of the character design is very lanky and one-note, and there's no real sense of action. This series can't get cancelled quickly enough.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>MAGU-CHAN: GOD OF DESTRUCTION</strong><br><strong>37 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JUNE 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/11-Magu-chan-God-of-Destruction.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/11-Magu-chan-God-of-Destruction-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/11-Magu-chan-God-of-Destruction-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/11-Magu-chan-God-of-Destruction-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/11-Magu-chan-God-of-Destruction-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/11-Magu-chan-God-of-Destruction-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/11-Magu-chan-God-of-Destruction-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>Magu-chan was the first in a slew of comedy manga that came out last summer. At the time, I didn't really care for Magu-chan, because its premise seems shallow at first. But this is a surprisingly deep series that I've come to love dearly.<br><br>The plot of Magu-chan: God of Destruction kicks off when a young girl named Ruru, while digging for clams on the beach, finds a gem and accidentally unleashes an ancient spirit named Magu Menueku. Magu enjoyed a period of time on Earth as an all-powerful god of destruction, but there's a problem. With so much time sealed away, and his old cult dissolved, Magu arrives back on Earth as a tiny and underpowered octopus-like creature who nobody seems to remember.</p>\n<p>The good news for him - and Ruru - is that Ruru lives alone, and is happy to have a new friend. The two begin living together and bond over their shared experiences. Slowly over time, the cast grows larger, with both new human characters and new supernatural gods and spirits.<br><br>\"A human teaches a nonhuman creature how to exist in the real world\" is a fairly common trope; hell, it was even used in the first live-action Thor movie. What makes Magu-chan work so well for me is how much these two need each other. Ruru lives alone and needs a lot more support and friendship than she has, and Magu-chan needs followers to have any power. But since nobody in Ruru's friendgroup is willing to be a cult member, what that translates to here is that he needs friends.<br><br>Ruru's the heart of the series, especially as her friendgroup meets more and more nonhuman gods and spirits. She's extremely kindhearted and frequently forgets to think of herself, and part of her character arc is about learning how to be a little bit selfish and get more support. I found that extremely sweet and relatable.<br><br>There's one more bit of uniqueness that Magu-chan has going for it, and I suspect it's the main reason (along with the sweet heart at the series core) that the series has lasted so long. More than any other currently running series, Magu-chan celebrates the changing of the seasons. It's had chapters coinciding with Halloween, Valentine's Day, Christmas, spring break, and more. That's kind of an important staple for Jump, and no other series right now is really doing that.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>AYAKASHI TRIANGLE</strong><br><strong>38 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JUNE 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/12-Ayakashi-Triangle.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/12-Ayakashi-Triangle-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/12-Ayakashi-Triangle-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/12-Ayakashi-Triangle-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/12-Ayakashi-Triangle-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/12-Ayakashi-Triangle-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/12-Ayakashi-Triangle-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>Ayakashi Triangle is a genderbend manga. You should have a sense of whether you'd like this series from that short description, because that's pretty much the only card this series has to play. But it's a pretty good card.<br><br>In the first chapter, childhood friends Matsuri (an exorcist ninja) and Suzu (a spirit medium) go up against Shirogane, the King of Ayakashi. As they're about to defeat him, Shirogane laments that his defeat could cause the two childhood friends to become closer, and maybe even hook up. He casts a spell on Matsuri to change his gender, hoping that the two best friends both being girls will stop them from beginning a romantic relationship.<br><br>Incredibly, he's successful. Both Matsuri and Suzu feel weird about the idea of dating each other while they're both girls, but they also clearly have an affection for each other. So Matsuri works hard to get turned back into a boy, while Suzu learns about her own powers as a spiritual medium.<br><br>So yeah, there's really no getting around this: Ayakashi Triangle is horny. Easily the horniest series of the bunch, which Jump noticed, because it's the only series that you can't read thru the app; you have to read it thru a browser on a computer. It's actually a replacement for Jump's previous ecchi series (a term used for content that's sexually charged), Yuuna &amp; the Haunted Hot Springs, which ended right before this debuted last summer.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with a horny series; Ayakashi Triangle never has explicit content, and it still fits within the general tone of Jump. And as a transgender person, I'm a sucker for genderbend manga; I've read plenty of Ranma 1/2. But you'd kinda hope that a genderbend manga would have a little more to it than that, and Ayakashi Triangle really doesn't.<br><br>It does try. Just like Ranma 1/2, Ayakashi Triangle frequently adds new characters who could distract one or both of the leads from their relationship with each other, hence the title \"Ayakashi Triangle.\" But whereas Ranma had a believable web of characters and relationships, Matsuri and Suzu are too close with each other for distractions to be believable. <br><br>In addition, there's not much experimentation with the idea of Matsuri and Suzu loving each other as girls. And over time, Matsuri loses interest in turning back into a boy, and the plot's focus shifts to Suzu's powers and her role within the ayakashi world. The friends' relationship, which is the core of the series, kinda gets put on hold.<br><br>There's still some good magic and ayakashi action here, and the series is beautifully drawn by Kentaro Yabuki, who's done work on older long-running series Black Cat and To Love Ru. But Ayakashi Triangle definitely underwhelms me more often than I'd like.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>MASHLE: MAGIC &amp; MUSCLES</strong><br><strong>56 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JANUARY 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/13-Mashle-Magic-and-Muscles.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/13-Mashle-Magic-and-Muscles-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/13-Mashle-Magic-and-Muscles-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/13-Mashle-Magic-and-Muscles-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/13-Mashle-Magic-and-Muscles-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/13-Mashle-Magic-and-Muscles-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/13-Mashle-Magic-and-Muscles-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>This one took me a couple tries to really get into, but now I definitely understand why this one is so popular. It's a pretty excellent series.<br><br>So here's the deal: Jump lost A LOT of its most popular long-running series last year, including Haikyu, The Promised Neverland, and Kimetsu no Yaiba. Jump's been keeping an eye out for up-and-comers that could potentially go the distance, and as a result, both Mashle and Undead Unluck (below) have received a pretty substantial marketing push. It seems to have worked; sales for the two series are good so far, which is helped by the series themselves being very very well done.<br><br>Mashle, like the anime Little Witch Academia before it, is a magical school series that seems to be a direct response to Harry Potter. This is most prominently reflected in the protagonist Mash's (fake) scar-shaped facial marking, and in the chapter titles and collection covers that echo elements of the Harry Potter series.<br><br>The premise is this: in a dystopian fantasy world, anybody without magical powers is killed by the government. The unmagical Mash Burnedead lives in the forest with his father, who has trained Mash so much that Mash now has incredible physical strength. When the government finds out about Mash and his father's magicless existence, they threaten to kill them both. Mash impresses them so much with his physical strength that the government official gives him an impossible task: go to magical school and become a Divine Visionary, and they'll allow him to live.<br><br>Class struggle is really the heart and soul of Mashle. Within the halls of the magical school (which is already a place in which the lowest class, nonmagical people, are banned from existence), the characters with the most social status and magical power are invariably rich upperclass snobs and assholes. Mash is an unstoppable force that pretty much nobody is ready to confront. Some befriend him, and others fight him, but pretty much nobody is able to really break him.<br><br>It's extremely cathartic, especially with how poorly Harry Potter has aged over time. A lot of the core elements that lead to the class struggle at this series' forefront are identical to Harry Potter: nonmagical people were banned from Hogwarts, and the main character of that series inherited a large fortune and was the child of two powerful and popular magic users. Only this time, characters like Harry Potter are usually the antagonists. The only main trait Mash shares with Harry is his close circle of friends.<br><br>I haven't seen this sort of direct response to Harry Potter stateside, but this is the second time I've seen a major mainstream Japanese series that's a direct response to and critique of Harry Potter. Just a few years ago, Little Witch Academia portrayed a magical school in which its bureaucracy and students were out of touch with society, its tech was out of date, and the relevance of magic was fading as a result. In that series, it also took a lower-class outsider to start really changing the system for the better. In Harry Potter, Hogwarts was a magical and wondrous place; in Little Witch and Mashle, the magical school is itself a major source of the series' conflict.<br><br>No wonder Mashle is popular, especially with how far J.K. Rowling has fallen in recent years. But here's what matters: this doesn't just work in response to Harry Potter, but on its own terms as well. Mashle is very funny, visually stunning, and frequently surprising. It has a fantastic cast of characters. It has the heart and determination that fuels the best of the Jump series. Mashle deserves to run for as long as the mangaka wants to write and draw it, and given the current state of Jump, I'd say it'll be around for a good while.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>UNDEAD UNLUCK</strong><br><strong>57 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JANUARY 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/14-Undead-Unluck.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/14-Undead-Unluck-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/14-Undead-Unluck-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/14-Undead-Unluck-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/14-Undead-Unluck-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/14-Undead-Unluck-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/14-Undead-Unluck-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>Undead Unluck is a straight-up fantastic series, and it's in close competition for my favorite series currently running in Jump. So far, only one other series (the next entry) is a strong contender.<br><br>18-year-old Fuuko Izumo has a strange power: anybody who touches her gets hit with a stroke of bad luck, often bad enough to injure or kill them. Having finished her favorite manga, she decides to kill herself. A strange man sees her about to jump and hears about her bad luck, and touches her in order to receive her bad luck. He immediately gets hit by a train, but it doesn't kill him; turns out he's an undead zombie, and he's looking for a way to get killed for real. The two (Undead and Unluck) embark on a quest to figure out how to help the zombie (who Fuuko names Andy) find a final death.<br><br>That's a pretty basic premise that doesn't necessarily seem like it could expand into a full-length series. Mangaka Yoshifumi Tozuka, who's done a few Jump one-shots and writes his first full series here, slowly expands the concept into something epic and heartfelt. This starts when Fuuko and Andy discover that there's other \"negators\" with strange supernatural abilities starting with the letters \"Un-\". <br><br>And if there's other people with abilties, of course there's groups of people with these abilities, like the Union. And if there's groups of people with these abilities, of course they're embarking on a quest to save the universe from total destruction by embarking on difficult sidequests to capture or kill other negators and embodied rules of the universe. ... Wait, what?<br><br>The writing of this series is SO SO GOOD. Nearly every character in its extensive cast is likeable and/or interesting, and the characters have great depth to them. The overarching plot, which deals with the strange way in which this world works, is fascinating to watch unfold.<br><br>If I have any qualms about the series, it's that it feels like the main characters don't drive the plot so much, but merely happen to be involved in it. That's not the case for the last entry on this list, in which the characters and the plot inform each other constantly. But it's a small quibble. Undead Unluck is cool, and it's gripping, and it's heartwrenching, and it's sweet, and it's fun. It's a top-tier Jump series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>MISSION: YOZAKURA FAMILY</strong><br><strong>76 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED AUGUST 2019</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/15-Mission-Yozakura-Family.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/15-Mission-Yozakura-Family-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/15-Mission-Yozakura-Family-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/15-Mission-Yozakura-Family-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/15-Mission-Yozakura-Family-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/15-Mission-Yozakura-Family-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/15-Mission-Yozakura-Family-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>I am completely blown away by how much I've turned around on this series. It easily takes the Most Improved Player award, and might be my favorite series currently running.<br><br>Taiyo and Mutsumi are childhood friends. Taiyo lost his family in a car accident somewhat recently, and Mutsumi has a large family of super-spies of all ages. When her overprotective brother Kyoichiro threatens to kill Taiyo for getting too close to Mutsumi, the other members of Mutsumi's family suggest an unusual plan: if Taiyo marries Mutsumi and becomes a family member, Kyoichiro will be unable to kill Taiyo because of the family rules that forbid killing other family members. Ultimately, Taiyo decides to marry Mutsumi after all, regaining the family that he lost in the car accident.<br><br>What follows is a spy manga that's structured like a gag manga. Nearly every chapter in the first 20-30 are self-contained stories with strong comedy elements, as Taiyo learns how to become a super-spy so he can protect his wife, and so he can hold his own in missions with his family members. However, because of the plot-heavy nature of the missions, each chapter has a lot more exposition than the average gag manga, so it takes a good deal of time to read.<br><br>Now, Yozakura Family is not the only Jump series to deal with a family of spies. Spy x Family, another currently running series that's exclusive to the Jump+ app, has been significantly more popular and better-selling than Yozakura Family. So I was curious as to why Mission: Yozakura Family has been allowed to run for over a year and counting.<br><br>Well, around the 30 chapter mark, this series really clicked for me. Things started coming together. Whereas the first bunch of chapters focuses on individual elements (a supporting character here, a subplot there), as the series gets closer to 40 chapters those elements start finally building to create a greater whole. The greater plot starts to get unveiled. The characters, which have now each been established and developed in earlier chapters spotlighting them, get to all work together.<br><br>And Mission: Yozakura Family reveals itself as having some of the deepest and richest emotion of any Jump series I've read so far. It's about being part of a family of weirdos, and loving and accepting all of them even with their strange traits. (Except for the ones that are actively harmful.) It's about the long-term effects of grief and trauma, and finding comfort and salvation in the love of the people around you. It's about two people, Taiyo and Mutsumi, in a beautiful mutually supportive relationship, and how they care for each other even when they don't know how.<br><br>Mission: Yozakura Family is cool and fun as hell, especially with all the weird superpowers and crazy situations the characters find themselves in on a regular basis. But what really tips it over the edge is an attention to character and a depth of emotion that's really unlike just about any manga series I've ever read. Mission: Yozakura Family is the real deal, and more people should read it.<br><br><br><br><br></p>",

So I do think it's worth keeping around for now.<br><br>With that preamble out of the way, here is a rundown of the games in Humble's monthly bundles for February 2021 and February 2016, ranked from best to worst.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>HUMBLE FEBRUARY 2021 BUNDLE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>1) Werewolf The Apocalypse: Heart of the Forest</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>This is the first game in any 2021 bundle that I've played thru to completion, just to give you a sense of how much I liked it.<br><br>Werewolf: The Apocalypse is a tabletop roleplaying game in the same universe as Vampire: The Masquerade. Both are storytelling-heavy systems in which you play as a member of a secret clan of monster people. These games are SO much more narratively-focused than Dungeons &amp; Dragons that it makes a lot of sense to translate these systems in a videogame sphere to something more linear like a visual novel.<br><br>Last month, VTM: Shadows of New York mixed good art and deep writing to create a rich visual novel experience. This month, WTA: Heart of the Forest is doing the same thing, but a little bit better.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>In both games, you play as a queer girl trying to find herself. Whereas in VTM: Shadows of New York you played as a down-on-her-luck investigative journalist, here you play as a girl just trying to find her heritage in the depths of Poland. Along with her friend, she travels to a town she's seen in her dreams, and the mystical forest and strange townspeople slowly help her understand her nature as a newborn werewolf.<br><br>One of my critiques of these visual novels is this: in translating a robust tabletop roleplay system, there's a lot of ideas and definitions the game needs to inorganically teach you. Shadows of New York did this by throwing definitions at you every couple of minutes, but Heart of the Forest solves this problem rather elegantly with its best gameplay decision: an honest-to-Gaia in-game character sheet.</p>\n<p>As you progress thru the game, the decisions you make slowly build your character sheet. Your relationship with various characters is recorded, as are all your stats. Depending on what actions you take, you can gain or spend points in all sorts of areas.<br><br>This also means that the game *feels* more interactive than Shadows of New York. I'm unsure how much your choices actually change the story, but the writing tweaks itself to what your character cares about and how they're feeling.<br><br>I dunno, something about the Werewolf setting, which is very much about being an environmental activist, resonates with me more than the Vampire setting, which is more generically about being part of a monstrous secret society. This game really grabbed me, I loved the main character I built, and it was a treat to see this story to the end. I'd happily play a sequel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>2) Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Trine-4-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>I'm sort of surprised they're still making Trine games. Trine has been around since the beginning of the indie boom in the late 2000s. It's a series of 2.5D puzzle platformers (that is, 2D platformers where the grapics are rendered in 3D). The third installment supposedly took a detour into 3D platforming, but after that was received poorly, Trine 4 is back to the 2.5D formula the series began with.<br><br>This is the only Trine game I've ever played with, so I can't really get a sense of how similar or different it is to the other games, or if the narrative really needed a fourth installment. Certainly the plot reads as a standalone \"our established heroes must embark on a one-and-done quest\" kind of thing.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Trine-4-gameplay-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>All I can tell you is that this game plays very well. The puzzle platforming is not terribly difficult, but it is very engaging. I keep wanting to play just a little bit more to see what's around the corner.<br><br>And it is a BEAUTIFUL game. Seriously, the art design in this game is absolutely stunning. Even if the game is a somewhat shallow experience, it's a very well-made shallow experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>3) Train Station Renovation</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Train-Station-Renovation-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>What is it with me and job simulator games? Train Station Renovation is a game in which you go to old decrepit train stations, and you clean them up. That's the whole game, and it rocks.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>It's not as good as PC Building Sim, for a few reasons. The music's not as good, for one thing, and in a long meditative game that's an important factor. Also, the process of cleaning up a train station is somewhat inherently longer than that of cleaning up a PC, which means that I don't really see the game progress and evolve here. A single game session of Train Station Renovation will probably include only one station, whereas a single session of PC Building Sim could see me work with at least half a dozen computers.<br><br>But ultimately, none of that matters too much, because the gameplay loop of Train Station Renovation is just inherently deeply satisfying. It even lets you customize the look of your train stations! What more could you really ask for?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>4) Co-Open</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Co-Open-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>This month's Humble Original is a fascinating little game. You play as a small child, and your parent has brought you to the grocery store. Your job is to collect and purchase groceries, by yourself, for the first time ever. Once you've selected seven items, you can bring them to the register and pay for them. Then your parent will pick you up and take you home.<br><br>You'd think there'd be some kind of structure to the game, maybe a list of groceries you're supposed to collect. But nope. The dialogue in the ending cutscene will change depending on what you've bought, but no matter what your parent will be pleased with your choices. What you buy is completely up to you.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Co-Open-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Surely that can't be the whole game, I thought. So I booted it up a second time. And it turns out I was right! There is a little bit more to the game. But not much, and it's not explicitly structured. If you wander around, you'll find other characters perusing the aisles. You can also find other secret areas, both inside and outside the building. All of these give you other characters to talk to, and little sidequests for you to try. You'll get a little reward to collect if you complete them. And as soon as you're done, you check out at the grocery store and your parent will pick you up.<br><br>There's really nothing pushing you to play more, besides the \"collections\" screen in the main menu that shows you all the achievements you've unlocked. It's just a cozy, well-made little grocery store simulator, with just a bit more exploration and sidequests than you might expect. And I think it's really sweet. You really feel the wonder and overwhelm of being a small child in this situation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>5) Iris &amp; the Giant</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Iris-and-the-Giant-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>A game in which you proceed thru the Greek underworld, killing monsters, based on randomly generated powers. No, this isn't Hades. It's a sweet little game called Iris &amp; the Giant, in which you play an outcast high school girl who battles her way thru leagues of warriors in the underworld.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>The gimmick here is that you can only do actions from a deck of cards that you draw randomly from: sword, shield, bow and arrow, axe, health pickups, and more are all drawn from your deck of actions. I THINK this is sort of similar to Slay the Spire?<br><br>It's very very simple. But this works. Other than the flavor, the other way this game parallels Hades is that you get little bonuses each time you play that make the game a little easier each time. I'm always curious what else I'm going to find around the next corner, and so I keep coming back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>6) Outward</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Outward-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>This is a very odd one. I'm not sure I'd call anything at this position or below a really good game. But Outward is absolutely fascinating.<br><br>Outward is a third-person fantasy RPG. But at some point, the developers of this game said, \"what if we also made this a survival game?\" And then they leaned really really hard on that aspect of the game, making Outward an odd fusion.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Outward-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1916\" height=\"1078\"></figure>\n<p>I'd almost call Outward a roguelike. On my first playthru, I woke up with the villagers mad at me and threatening to take away my lighthouse home unless I paid them off. So I started wandering around the village looking for supplies, and then I fell off a cliff. \"Okay,\" I thought, \"surely this game has autosave, and I can try again.\" Nope! I woke up in an inn, having slept off my injuries for several days. When I returned to my lighthouse, the window for that quest had passed, and I'd already lost my home.<br><br>Further playthroughs were really similar. I'd try to do something, encounter some strange catastrophe that completely derailed my plans, and then the game would just continue and I was expected to muddle things out. You get to a point eventually where it just makes more sense to start over, but every time I played I learned a little bit more about how the world worked, and where important things were on the map, and stuff like that.<br><br>I don't think this is very good game design. It's very frustrating to play at times. But I've never played a game quite like this, either, and I sort of have to respect this game giving me a singularly unique game experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>7) Valkyria Chronicles 4</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>This series wants to be Fire Emblem so fucking bad, y'all.<br><br>I played a bit of the first game years and years ago.

The game takes place in an anime knockoff version of World War II, which is already cloying enough. The characters are all stereotypes. But here's the worst part: Valkyria Chronicles often has multiple cutscenes in a row, and between cutscenes it will boot you back to the main menu and force you to select the next one. And then confirm that yes, I'm really sure I want to watch it. It's exasperating.<br><br>I'm surprised this game ranked this high. But once you actually get into a battle, if you can ignore the story and characters, there's some interesting and decently fun tactics experiences. I threw all my soldiers at a challenge and got a lot of them killed, and then had to hold out while I waited for reinforcements. That was a tense little sequence, and it's the only situation in which VC4 provided any sort of unique experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>8) Boomerang Fu</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Boomerang-Fu-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>This is a pretty decent party game. In Boomerang Fu, you play as a living piece of food, and you dash around a small arena trying to kill everybody else with boomerangs.

I was about equally matched with my CPU opponent on my first playthru, and the CPU ended up winning. But I noticed that while I would haphazardly throw my boomerang around and then go running for it, the CPU kept running up and slicing my throat.<br><br>So on a second playthru, I tried using the boomerang as just a generic melee weapon, like a sword or knife. And lo and behold, that worked way better. Maybe cause there's no way implemented to aim or lock-on with the boomerang, it's sort of frustrating to use as a throwing implement, and there's a lot less x-factor in a big brawl if you just run around and stab people.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>9) Lovecraft's Untold Stories</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>What if Spelunky was a top-down 2D exploration game, and also it was themed around Cthulhu cultists and other Lovecraft references?

In Overcooked, different people will take different jobs because of how spread out the resources are: chopping, dishwashing, cooking, serving, etc. Moving Out doesn't really have that. You move your own items until you get to a piece of furniture that needs two people, and then you ask your friend \"hey come help me with this,\" and then you move it outside and go back to what you were doing before.<br><br>The basic goal of a level is to fit everything into the moving truck, and this is where the game really fails. Again, you can sort of see the logic, but the physics really don't let you place the furniture carefully at all. You just sort of throw it into the truck, and hope that once you get to the end of the level, you'll be able to slam the door closed.<br><br>This game was not fun at all.

The alien's AI is really fun to play with; it feels like a dance, keeping an eye and ear out for it while trying to navigate around the station. At times, the game resembles a blockbuster action movie, especially towards the end, but the pacing is so good that it really deserves the ramp up.</span></p>\n<p>I think the most impressive part of this game is how it programs you. The most interesting antagonist of the game is actually Sevastopol Station itself, a decaying wreck full of capitalist propaganda. This game is full of little contextual button prompts for mechanics like starting up a generator or welding thru a locked door, but they're repeated so often that you end up memorizing them, and rotely performing the tasks like you're a worker on Sevastopol yourself. It's one of the most fascinating reactions to a game I've ever had, and really resonates great with the anti-corporate story.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>2) Broken Age</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Broken-Age-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>This game received a pretty mixed reception when it first came out.

How far the mighty have fallen. I think this game was really well received, years and years ago. Certainly I remember it being... at least intriguing, although I never got very far. This is a pixelly indie game, very much in the style of early indie games like Fez and Superbrothers, in which you play a small warrior with a bow and arrow, trying to destroy several bosses. There is no level design outside the bosses. It's just a boss rush game.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Titan-Souls-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>So those bosses gotta be pretty well-designed for this to work, and let me tell you, I could not finish a single boss in this game. Your movement controls don't work great, and you have to summon your single arrow back to you every time you fire it. You also only have a single hit point; if you get hit once, you die and have to try the boss again. If you're really good at boss fights, this might be for you, but it's way too difficult for me.</p>\n<p> </p>",

And he forwarded the plot of the X-Men titles by depicting the trial of Gambit in Antarctica. And his one-off story about Jean &amp; Grey fighting a psychic force on an airplane was pretty fun.

There's a sequence in the middle where werewolf Jack Russell takes a carnival ride to Hell and confronts his inner demons, which is really strong stuff.</p>\n<p>Of course the series ends on a cliffhanger, and curiously with the same plot beat that vampire Hannibal King faced in Journey Into Mystery: Jack wakes up to find that he's killed somebody for the first time ever.

In this issue, she takes up her father's legacy and becomes the new Spider-Girl. Much like Amazing Fantasy, this issue would become so popular that it would spin off into its own series, which would launch later in 1998.<br><br>None of the other issues of What If that I've read reach that high bar, but many come close. I've previously read a few issues of What If from the mid-2000s, and they tend to be pretty dark. But here, What If refuses to ignore these characters' essential goodness and the hope that they represent. <br><br>In one issue, DeFalco wonders what would happen if the X-Men were harder on Gambit after he betrays the team. In the end, they're unable to truly hurt him because he's still their friend. In another issue, Apocalypse turns Wolverine into a brainwashed villain, inadvertently creating an enemy large enough to rally the world against him and bring about an everlasting peace. But that doesn't end in Wolverine's death; it's revealed that he broke free of the brainwashing and is searching for his own inner peace.<br><br>Of course some issues are downers, but in those cases it kinda feels like the characters had it coming. Perhaps the most tragic issue of this bunch is the one starring the Fantastic Four, in which the Thing decides to abandon his teammates for a happy life with Alicia Walters in a tiny villain-created utopia, ignoring the battle they must face and lying to Alicia about the true nature of their peace. The story ends with his teammates dead, Alicia distraught, and the Thing trapped in his false utopia, giving him karmic retribution for his actions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Wolverine vol 2 #119-127, Annual 1997</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"3216\" height=\"1964\"></figure>\n<p>Even before the X-Men movie in 2000, Wolverine is one of Marvel's most popular characters. So with a Wolverine series, Marvel can do pretty much anything they want. What they've elected to do here is give the reins to a new writer every story arc.<br><br>Warren Ellis takes the first four issues, a tale called \"Not Dead Yet\" which sees Wolverine tracking down and fighting a murderous asshole he used to go drinking with. The dialogue is sparse but the writing is *on point* and Leinil Yu's art is bold, so it's kinda one of my favorite self-contained arcs I've read in this project.<br><br>After a brief interlude from John Ostrander &amp; Joe Edkin for the annual (it's pretty good, it focuses on Wolverine's ability to lose control), Tom DeFalco takes the reins for a couple of one-off issues. The first one pits him against Roughouse and Bloodscream, two villains DeFalco also used over in Amazing Spider-Man. I don't know why DeFalco cares about them, they're pretty boring. The second is a crossover with Captain America. Both are fine.<br><br>Then Chris Claremont takes over, and... y'know, Claremont's praised as one of the best X-Men writers of all time, but between this and his work over in Fantastic Four this year, I really do not see it. The plot is that Wolverine's been manipulated into making good on a promise he made to marry Viper. Several of the women in his life try to stop him, and Kitty Pryde sticks around for the immediate fallout. It's kind of gross? I mean, Kitty's one of my favorite characters, I'm all for seeing her in more comics, but she kinda just gets used by the villain here, and Viper is just a bitch. And the story's super unfocused too, Wolverine takes an entire issue to mess with some Hydra goons for reasons seemingly unrelated to the main story. Ugh.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>X-Factor #140-148</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Factor-140-142.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-140-142-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-140-142-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-140-142-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-140-142-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-140-142-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-140-142-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2896\" height=\"1492\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Factor-143-148.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-143-148-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-143-148-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-143-148-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-143-148-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-143-148-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Factor-143-148-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"5884\" height=\"1504\"></figure>\n<p>For a series that's one of my favorites when it relaunches as a scrappy detective noir series in the 2000s, this iteration of X-Factor is really not doing it for me. There really wasn't a perfect jumping-on point for me to start reading this series cause it's all kind of a mess, so I did the best I could and read these nine issues. <br><br>Maybe the biggest problem of the main stuff is that I just don't care about the main cast. Wildchild, Dark Beast, Alex Summers, and Polaris are all kinda boring. Even Madrox doesn't manage to make things much better in his one appearance. It's a shame because series writer Howard Mackie is also working on adjectiveless Spider-Man, and he's doing a much better job over there. Maybe he was just dealt a bad hand.<br><br>The biggest plot-related thing that happens is a group of mutants from the future called the Xavier Underground Enforcers (not to be confused with the group they split off from, the Xavier Security Enforcers) arrive in the present in the bodies of new people whose identities they've now erased. There's some business where the characters visit the old lives of the people they've bodysnatched and try to make things better, but it's pretty messy.<br><br>The highlight of the series so far might be #147, written by guest writer Joseph Harris, about the mutant Shard trying to help out a bullied kid whose classmates think he's a mutant. Once he finds out he's not a mutant but is actually just double-jointed, he joins in with his classmates to bully Shard. That's a pretty sad but ultimately cohesive little story.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>X-Force #70-80</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Force-70-74.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-70-74-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-70-74-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-70-74-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-70-74-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-70-74-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-70-74-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"9136\" height=\"2792\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Force-75-80.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-75-80-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-75-80-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-75-80-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-75-80-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-75-80-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Force-75-80-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2784\" height=\"718\"></figure>\n<p>The original point of this comic was that it was Cable's special spin-off team that he led in order to help him stop the bad stuff that would cause chaos in his home timeline. At the point when I started reading, X-Force decided they wanted to do their own thing, and Cable left to have adventures on his own.<br><br>So now X-Force, written almost entirely by John Francis Moore, is the slightly older edition of Generation X: a group of young people dealing with things separately from the main X-Men cast. While Gen X focuses on the whimsy of children, the X-Force team deals with plots and themes more appropriate for its slightly older cast in their teens and 20s. X-Force goes on a road trip, visits a Woodstock-esque festival, and grapples with their inner demons. Warpath has an extended arc in which he seeks out the people who massacred his village, gets killed, and is resurrected. Then Sunspot has a few issues in which he deals with a darker version of himself, Reignfire, who claims to be the same person as Sunspot and briefly possesses him.<br><br>Like with X-Factor, it could be a cast thing, where they haven't really chosen characters that I care about. Maybe if I'd been following since this team debuted in New Mutants Vol 1, I'd be more emotionally invested. I like Domino, but her subplot only shows up every so often.<br><br>It could also be that these characters have enough wealth and power that it doesn't really feel like they're struggling. They go on a cross-country trip without much trouble, and their funding being cut off is only a brief problem. The book just feels kind of dated (which the Woodstock bash doesn't help), and the characters are unlikeable and unrelatable. I hope the series gets better.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>X-Man #31-41</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Man-31-35.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-31-35-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-31-35-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-31-35-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-31-35-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-31-35-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-31-35-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"5032\" height=\"1556\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Man-36-41.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-36-41-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-36-41-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-36-41-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-36-41-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-36-41-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-36-41-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"5968\" height=\"1548\"></figure>\n<p>This was so close to being my least favorite title of the project. Only Elektra managed to beat it out at the last minute.<br><br>For a start, it's a grim gritty superhero being really really angsty about how cursed he is to have all these superpowers and be such a beloved figure. Literally, there's an arc about halfway thru this stretch where Nate's really angsty about that, and then the Purple Man proves him right by manipulating people to first love him and then hate him. Oh my gods, get over yourself.<br><br>But that's not what makes this series so bad. What I absolutely loathed was how it treats characters with mental illness. In two cases, with the villains Hybrid and Jackknife, Nate makes them more mentally unstable with his psychic powers. Rather than helping them, Nate just hits them for a while until they stop fighting him, either because of serious bodily harm or flat-out disintegration. Nate doesn't really come to terms with what he's done and certainly doesn't seek to make amends. It's just presumed that we won't sympathize with the ultimate fate of the villains because they're, well, *crazy*. And this isn't some kind of undetailed undescribed insanity, either - these characters have clear cases of multiple personality disorder, repression, and schizophrenia. And these characters are left to suffer, even more than before Nate interacted with them. Writer Terry Kavanagh should be ashamed of this work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>X-Man &amp; Incredible Hulk Annual 1998</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"469\" height=\"361\"></figure>\n<p>This annual is better than the X-Man ongoing because Hulk is in it, mostly calling the shots, and because the villain isn't a mentally ill person but fucking Thanos, still trying to break out of his cosmic prison from the Ka-Zar series.

From month to month, its cast is the main group of X-Men hanging out at the mansion, which is stronger than Uncanny's approach because the main team has a few unusual characters that shake up the dynamic a bit. Specifically, Marrow and Maggot and Cecilia Reyes are all relatively new additions to the team, and a lot of the drama involves them trying and occasionally failing to fit in with their peers.<br><br>Appropriately, this title is also where we get more relevant plot developments. The mutant following the X-Men around who thinks he's a reformed Magneto finds out he's actually somebody else. (This will come back around in an event in a few months.) A call for help that brings Storm and the X-Men to Africa results in Psylocke setting off a massive psychic trap, which is felt by several characters across titles such as X-Man and Generation X. <br><br>It feels like, if you wanted to follow just one X-book to know what was going on at the time, this would be the one you'd pick up. And I really liked it. I think Joe Kelly takes the time he needs to flesh out characters - little interactions like Wolverine bonding with Maggot and Angel talking down Marrow are pretty heartwarming, cause it feels like they're being brought into the fold even tho both Marrow and Maggot look pretty gross and feel like they're outcasts. But then Kelly also folds these into larger plot beats; the oversized 75th issue shows them tracking down the murderers who framed Maggot, and it's an appropriate catharsis given how much Maggot's struggled throughout the course of this title.<br><br>So not only is this the essential X-book to read if you only wanted to read one X-book in 1998, but it's my pick for the best of the X-books. All of the other series feel compromised in some way, but X-Men managed to make me love characters I'd never heard of before with kinda gross powersets. That's what X-Men should be at its best - a family where you weren't expecting one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>X-Men &amp; Alpha Flight vol 2 #1-2</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"614\" height=\"471\"></figure>\n<p>Because Marvel loves Alpha Flight, here's another X-Men / Alpha Flight crossover, an untold story from early in both team's runs.

This hit shelves very close to the time when What If did a feature on an alternate reality in which the X-Men swore vengeance against him, and between these two issues, I'm actually pretty hyped to see what'll happen to Gambit next.

One of my strategies is the Retro Games project, another feature of this blog. That project is largely (but not entirely) based around franchises represented in the Super Smash Bros. series, which has become kind of a catch-all for a big section of video gaming.</p>\n<p>But I want to rewind to the early 2010s for a minute. In 2012, a friend told me about a bundle of games, some of which I'd heard were modern classics, being sold for very cheap. All of them could run on my underpowered laptop. That bundle was Humble Indie Bundle V.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/humbleindiebundleV-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"433\" height=\"615\"></figure>\n<p>This was Humble's fifth major project (but 13th overall) bringing together a group of games under a low price to raise money for charity. Pretty much every game in this bundle is fantastic: Psychonauts, Bastion, Amnesia, Limbo, Braid, Superbrothers... it's a gold mine.<br><br>Indie Bundle V was also a good representation of the indie game development boom that began around that time. Thanks to the Xbox 360 and the Steam game store on PC, indie developers had new places to showcase their work. Humble and the indie boom kind of walked hand-in-hand for the next decade; Humble kept bringing together bundles of notable indies, along with the occasional blockbuster title.<br><br>Towards the end of 2015, Humble started another project: a subscription service that provided a grab bag of games every month. It's legitimately a great way to try out some underappreciated games. But here's the thing: I've been subscribed to Humble Monthly for years, but I've been really bad about actually playing the games. I figured it was time for that to change.<br><br>More recently, the Humble Monthly Bundle has required subscribers to choose which games from the bundle to play, rather than giving subscribers all the games. It'd be helpful if there was somebody talking about which games are actually worth playing, wouldn't it?<br><br>SO. This, the latest project of Project-Topia, has two goals every month.<br><br>1) Firstly and most importantly, this overview will rank and review every game in the most recent Humble Monthly Bundle every month. Hopefully this will give subscribers and non-subscribers alike a sense of what all these games are, and whether they're worth picking up.<br><br>2) Secondly, I'm going to be reviewing one retro Humble Bundle every month. For now, that's going to be whatever monthly bundle happened five years ago this month. So this month, I'll be reviewing the January 2021 and January 2016 bundles.<br><br>Everybody following that? Okay, cool. Let's get into it</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><br><br><strong>HUMBLE JANUARY 2021 BUNDLE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>1) PC Building Simulator</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1916\" height=\"1078\"></figure>\n<p>PC Building Simulator has shown up in my Steam recommendations from time to time, and every time I've thought, this is too ridiculous to exist. Surely the notion of playing a game about building gaming PCs, on a gaming PC, is too far up its own ass to be anything but pretentious and masturbatory. I figured I'd try this once, get the gist, and that'd be enough.<br><br>Out of all the games on this list, I've easily put the most time into PC Building Sim. Several evenings' worth. Cause it's not what I thought it was. I figured it'd be, like, a tool. If you wanted to build a gaming PC, then PC Building Sim could sort of point you in the right direction, or you could pretend to have a nicer PC by playing the game. But it's not that.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble01-PCBuildSim-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><br>In PC Building Simulator, you're running your uncle's PC repair shop. People email you with requests, and then send you their desktop PCs to fix, clean, and upgrade. Eventually, people start asking you to build PCs for them, but not until you put a fair bit of time into the game. Every in-game day you come into work, check your email for new jobs, order new parts for the jobs, and then get to work fixing the PCs that have come in.<br><br>Some of the game is automated; you're not required to know exactly which cable should go where. On the other hand, the game won't let you give the fixed PC back until you've put all the parts in, either, so there's a little bit to learn. You also have to figure out when parts will be compatible with each other. <br><br>It's very easy to get into a routine with this game. It's quite soothing. The in-game radio selection is great, too. I was reminded of Euro Truck Simulator 2. That game does have trucks in it, yes, but it's a compelling long-term experience because you're expected to grow your business with the jobs that you take. Same goes for PC Building Sim: if you only do an okay job, you'll just get PCs that need to be dusted out and de-virused, and it gets boring fast. But if you give your customers amazing service, your rating will go up and you'll start getting new things to do.<br><br>It did not escape me that it was a little weird coming off work in the evenings and booting up PC Building Sim, which is basically another work simulator. But I found this really cozy and endearing. A meditative atmosphere and a good soundtrack do a lot to endear me to a game.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><br><br><strong>2) Not Tonight</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble02-NotTonight-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>I don't know what it says about me, or maybe about the bundle in general, that my top two games of this group are job simulators. But yeah, here it is: what if Papers Please was set in Brexit.<br><br>Papers Please was a 2013 game in which you played a border crossing guard in the fictional fascist country Arstotzka. The player checks immigrants' IDs and paperwork before deciding whether or not to allow them entry. It was a legitimately fantastic and emotional game with a great core gameplay loop.<br><br>Not Tonight doesn't need to make up a fictional country to depict fascism. That's how far we've come in the last eight years, I guess. You play a person who lives in England but is threatened with deportation unless they show that they can make a living wage. You take jobs as a bouncer at various pubs and clubs, checking people's IDs and tickets to make sure they're allowed entry.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-NotTonight-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><br>The main gameplay of Not Tonight is verrrry similar to Papers Please. I think Papers Please was perhaps a bit more polished. This game asks you to switch between different gigs, and each gig has different requirements. You also get to spend time at home each day. Papers Please omitted those two things, and instead focused on a really polished and slowly escalating gameplay loop.<br><br>But it's not a bad thing to be a little rougher around the edges. The story of the game is sort of sad and pretty relatable, and I dig it. The pixel art is GORGEOUS. (Gorgeous art is sort of a theme in this bundle.) The music, overheard from each club you stand outside, is wonderful. Not Tonight is a bit more about your story than Papers Please, which was more about the stories of the people around you. I like both approaches for different reasons, and I really liked this game.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><br><br><strong>3) Vampire The Masquerade: Shadows of New York</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>VTM: Shadows of New York is a well-written and beautifully-drawn visual novel, and that's all it needed to be.<br><br>Vampire: The Masquerade is a tabletop roleplaying game, one of the most famous in the genre along with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Warhammer. But whereas D&amp;D and Warhammer are highly focused on combat, Vampire: The Masquerade takes a slower approach, and puts more emphasis on the stories you can tell within the setting. <br><br>As the title implies, you play a vampire, trying to get by while keeping your existence secret from humans (\"the masquerade\"). I have some prior experience with the setting, and I've found it to be generally more queer-friendly than other mainstream tabletop settings, too.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble03-VTMShadowsOfNewYork-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><br>So all this game had to do to succeed was tell a good story. And it does that. Shadows of New York follows Julia, a down-on-her-luck young journalist whose life is upended when she's chosen by her local vampire clan. The way that the game parallels the horrors of being a vampire with the horrors of existence in general is very on-the-nose.<br><br>There's not really any choices to make in the gameplay. Occasionally you get to choose Julia's response to other characters, but it doesn't seem to affect much. There's two endings to find, but that doesn't come up until right at the end. Shadows of New York sacrifices personal choice to tell a compelling and self-contained narrative, and I have zero problems with this. I can't get enough of this game's atmosphere and characters.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><br><br><strong>4) Heeey!

Some of these later get wider releases and become major successes, such as A Short Hike, Uurnog, Wilmot's Warehouse, and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. For a Humble Original to rank this high among a group of over a dozen games is a pretty big deal.<br><br>But yeah, here's Heeey! Park-Boy, this month's Humble Original, just below the vampire game and the job sims as my fourth favorite game of the month. The designer, Trey Brown, has said that they wanted to evoke the spirit of weird PS2 games with this game, specifically Katamari Damacy.

That's the game.<br><br>It's legitimately fantastic. It's sweet, it's endearing, the music is great, the visuals are pretty whimsical. It's got a bit of a Pikmin vibe to it, albeit a bit jankier.

The Ambassador: Fractured Timelines (really? that's the best name they could come up with?) is published by Quantum Astrophysicists Guild. QAG also published Deleveled, which is a little further down on this list, as well as some recent minor indie hits like The Bridge and Tumblestone. But the developer is a very small team making what looks like baby's first action game.<br><br>But... this really really works. The art's pretty basic, but the game is devilishly addictive.

Despite all the death, it's not that brutal. You get into sort of a rhythm in each level, trying to figure out the right way to go and testing your reflexes, experimenting with all your weapons.<br><br>There's some games further down this list that have some real money behind them, recognizable name brands and developers.

Your behavior is reflected in your clan, so they'll learn new behaviors along with you.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble12-Ancestors-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble12-Ancestors-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble12-Ancestors-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble12-Ancestors-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble12-Ancestors-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble12-Ancestors-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble12-Ancestors-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><br>Now, check out the gameplay image above. That is TOO MANY buttons. But that part doesn't actually surprise me. The movement controls of the original Assassin's Creed games are, like... weird. You had to hold down two or three buttons in order to run across roofs and parkour off walls. There was a bit of skill to getting used to some weird controls. But Ancestors doesn't really bring that together; there's just too many buttons to remember.<br><br>Even if you can remember all those buttons, the gameplay loop is essentially to investigate every single thing in the world. There's not really any choices to make, either; this isn't like Spore, where you can evolve in different directions. You're always going towards being more human; the only question is how good or bad you are at it.<br><br>So: awkward controls, pretentious story, boring game design, shoddy graphics. Nothing about this game works. It is a fascinating failed experiment that somebody put way too much money into.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>13) Total Tank Simulator</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>That's a hell of a claim to make in your title. \"This game has EVERYTHING you could POSSIBLY want to have out of a tank simulator.\" Okay, I'll bite, TTS, whatcha got?<br><br>So here's what we get.<br>1) A tactical game that basically amounts to \"place all the tanks you can afford onto the battle and hope you don't get steamrolled\".<br>2) The ability to step into one of those tanks and play in first person, trusting that the larger tactical game around you isn't going to blow up in the meantime.<br>3) That... seems to be about it.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble13-TotalTankSimulator-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><br>I have so many questions.

A bit like Myst, a bit like Portal, but with no puzzle concepts that are all that original. The Talos Principle is about moving boxes, reflecting lasers, and making copies of yourself to solve puzzles. It's very very basic.<br><br>But it's also meditative as hell. You have conversations with an AI. You explore ruins of old civilizations - Greek, Egyptian, and Medieval Europe. You find fragments of philosophical text and scientific journals. <br><br>In the margins of the puzzles, you're questioning the nature of your own existence and surroundings - both within the game and without it. But the majority of the game *is* the puzzles. It's like the game gives you some big things to think about, and then has you do some puzzles to occupy another part of your brain while you think about those things.<br><br>In construction, Talos Principle seems basic on the surface. But it is such a transcendentally good experience, I can't say enough good things about it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>2) Mushroom 11</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble02-Mushroom11-titel.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-titel-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-titel-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-titel-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-titel-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-titel-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-titel-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Mushroom 11 might be the only game I know where you play as an eraser.
