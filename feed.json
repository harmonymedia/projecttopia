            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-left\">I'm kind of astonished that a publication like Weekly Shonen Jump exists. Jump is a weekly magazine, with each issue containing the latest chapters in about 20 ongoing serialized manga series. Jump series are primarily action-adventure, which is an incredibly popular genre. In that sense, it's not too surprisingly that Jump is consistently the best-selling manga magazine in Japan.<br><br>What is surprising, and somewhat subversive, is the ethos of Jump. At its core, an enduring Jump series has to have a lot of heart. Jump does sometimes publish rote action series that are nothing but empty spectacle, but those series don't tend to endure, and are often cancelled quickly. If you want your Jump series to survive, a focus on love and friendship is essential.<br><br>Jump's weekly release schedule can be grueling to the writers and artists working on them, and that shouldn't be understated: another core pillar of the global entertainment industry built on the backs of capitalistic exploitation. Still, I'm heartened by the amount of hope, optimism, and love present in some of these series. The best ones come from a really special place, and affect me pretty deeply.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>HOW DID WE GET HERE?</strong></p>\n<p>Viz Media, the US manga publisher that has the stateside rights to Jump series, has tried to bring Jump to the US in different ways over the years. Many of the more popular series, like One Piece and Dragon Ball, find their way to the US via localized anime adaptations and several-hundred-page chapter collections. <br><br>The actual weekly publication, Weekly Shonen Jump, has appeared in English in a few forms. An altered version that mixed older and newer series received a monthly release in comic book stores, to share the shelves with characters like Spider-Man and Superman. As online media distribution rose to prominence in the 2010s, Viz instead attempted an online subscription to a digital version of the complete magazine.<br><br>Finally, in 2019, Viz cut out the middleman, and put up a huge archive of dozens of Jump series, updating each week with the newest chapters from Weekly Shonen Jump, along with other magazines like Jump Square, V Jump, and some online-exclusive series from Jump Plus. New chapters are free, and the archive is a couple bucks a month. It's an astonishingly good deal and a great system for catching up with old series. <br><br>Last spring, I learned about this archive and its low price, and I've been trying valiantly to catch up with the 20-ish series running in the weekly magazine ever since. I'm not quite done; Weekly Shonen Jump currently has five heavy-hitters that have each run for over a hundred chapters each, and I haven't finished any of them yet. These five are Jujutsu Kaisen (144 chapters), Dr. Stone (190 chapters), Black Clover (287 chapters), My Hero Academia (307 chapters), and One Piece (1008 chapters). <br><br>Each of these five series is very popular, in part because of successful anime adaptations that have received passionate fanbases and widespread critical acclaim. If you're tied into the manga/anime scene, you probably know at least a couple of those names.<br><br>But there's more to Jump than the big guns. What excites me just as much, if not more, is the newer series, some of which never make it past 100 or even 50 chapters. Their quality varies widely, but I think they all deserve a chance in the spotlight, because all of them are interesting.<br><br>So here we go: even though I haven't completely caught up with all 20 currently-running Weekly Shonen Jump series, I'm caught up with all 15 series that are under a hundred chapters as of the end of March 2021. And I'd like to do a quick rundown of where Jump is at right now. There's some pretty good stuff here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>NINE DRAGONS' BALL PARADE</strong><br><strong>7 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED FEBRUARY 2021</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/01-Nine-Dragons-Ball-Parade-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>It's pretty normal for Jump to have at least one sports manga running at any given time. The basketball manga Slam Dunk ran during the 90s, and subsequently appeared in the US localization of Jump in the 2000s. More recently, volleyball manga Haikyu enjoyed a long and successful run thru the 2010s, and a similarly succesful anime adaptation. <br><br>Haikyu was one of many series to end last year; 2020 saw an unusually large amount of turnover for Jump, making the number of current Jump series under 100 chapters unusually high. Here, about a year later, is a replacement: Nine Dragons' Ball Parade, a new baseball manga.<br><br>NDBP is Jump's most recent addition, the last of four new series that debuted at the beginning of 2021. It follows the adventures of a young catcher and pitcher as they follow their dreams to slowly build their own baseball team. The series has only been out a couple of months, and I kind of keep forgetting just how good it is from week to week. <br><br>The plot structure necessitates a very slow introduction of characters, so there's plenty of time to get to know each one as the series progresses. It reminds me a bit of One Piece's slow and methodical approach to building its main cast in Luffy's pirate crew. We've only got four main cast members so far, but I'm excited to see where the series goes with them, especially once they start getting into actual baseball games.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>WITCH WATCH</strong><br><strong>8 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED FEBRUARY 2021</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/02-Witch-Watch.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/02-Witch-Watch-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>Jump series are mostly categorized into two broad categories: series centered heavily around a serialized plot, with each chapter adding to a greater whole; and series that are mostly one-off stories, often focused on comedy, called \"gag manga.\" For instance, Witch Watch is straight-up a fantasy slice-of-life gag manga, and it's fantastic.<br><br>Witch Watch, by veteran mangaka Kenta Shinohara, follows a young witch named Nico and her ogre childhood best friend, Mori. When Mori learns that doom may soon befall the witch, he agrees to protect her as her personal bodyguard.<br><br>With stories about young witches, I generally expect the witch to be underpowered as she learns how to use her magic, such as in Kiki's Delivery Service or Little Witch Academia. In Witch Watch, Nico has no such handicap. She begins the story with extraordinary abilities, and performs a new unusual spell about once per chapter. This leads to some visually impressive sequences.<br><br>The story still has drama, though, because Nico has no idea how to interact with people, even though she badly wants to make friends and help as many people as possible. This openhearted and extroverted nature often clashes with Mori's overprotectiveness, which is the heart of the series' drama.<br><br>Right now, this is the series that excites me the most from week to week. It's fun, it's creative, and it's expertly drawn. Only two months in, and I'm totally on board with this one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>I TELL C</strong><br><strong>9 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED FEBRUARY 2021</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/03-i-tell-c.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/03-i-tell-c-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>i tell c is a mystery series, written and drawn by Kazusa Inaoka, who has contributed two short series to Jump in the last few years. It stars three detectives who go after serial killers together. Two of them are twin brothers, each with a different approach to solving crime. The third is a young woman who falls in love with the criminal of every case, and uses her considerable deductive powers to determine the criminal's identity so that she can date him. The two twin detectives tend to solve each case by following the young woman as she goes off on her own to find and profess her love to the criminal.<br><br>I really can't get a bead on this series yet. After a few chapters that felt relatively formulaic, the series kicked its plot into high gear and had a few chapters of serious consequence to the status quo. Since then, it's seemed to settle back into a new routine. The premise is definitely strange, and I'm not sure it's in a way that I like. But the art is good, and I end up caring about the woman detective more as her backstory is revealed, so... fingers crossed on this one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>THE ELUSIVE SAMURAI</strong><br><strong>10 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JANUARY 2021</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/04-The-Elusive-Samurai.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/04-The-Elusive-Samurai-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>This was the first new series to debut in 2021, and as a result it's the one that's settled the most into a routine from week to week. But it's still really really solid.<br><br>Yusei Matsui, who previously wrote a hugely popular series during the 2010s called Assassination Classroom, here tells the story of Hojo Tokiyuki, a young boy prince who just barely escapes his family's slaughter in the 1333 Siege of Kamakura. He's protected by Suwa Yorishige, a father figure with strange and prophetic visions of the future. Suwa takes Hojo under his wing in order to help train him, and gather an army to take back his homeland.<br><br>This is sort of a strange idea for a series on its face, especially if you know how the story ended in real life. (It's not a particularly shonen-friendly happy ending.) Even the manga itself admits in its narration that the characters are barely a footnote in historical texts.<br><br>But on a structural level, this is genius. It's the similar sort of training setup, along with slowly getting to know a steadily growing cast of characters, that you expect to see in battle manga like Naruto or Dragon Ball. </p>\n<p>And the characters themselves are fun. Suwa gets a bit grating at times; his visions frequently prophesize Shonen Jump itself, which is... a bit much. But the young Hojo is a totally charming character. His whole gimmick is that he's better at running away from things than anybody else, and Suwa decides to lean on that strength in his training. It's an unusual take, in a genre that valorizes courage, to celebrate the act of fleeing as a positive character trait and a valuable tactical strategy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>SAKAMOTO DAYS</strong><br><strong>17 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED NOVEMBER 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/05-Sakamoto-Days.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/05-Sakamoto-Days-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>Sakamoto Days is a series about an old and mute hitman named Sakamoto, who decides to retire from the assassination business to run a convenience store with his wife and daughter. The plot begins when people from his old life (first allies, and then enemies) begin to trickle back into his new life, and the series' drama revolves not only around whether he'll be able to protect his family, but also whether he'll be able to shield them from the potential psychological damage of being targeted by assassins.<br><br>Sakamoto Days is mostly (at first) a comedy manga, especially in its setup. The viewpoint character is Shin, an ally of Sakamoto's who's also a clairvoyant, so he can hear Sakamoto's thoughts and communicate with him telepathically. Sakamoto himself is a tubby dude, but he gets into action scenes with the vigor of a young man.<br><br>But it's the best type of comedy manga, because it's one that has serious drama for its characters. The stakes are high, but they're also hilarious; in one sequence, the wife and daughter decide to visit a haunted house at a funfair, and Sakamoto and Shin must protect them from assassins in a way that convinces them that the assassins are just part of the attraction.<br><br>As time has gone on, Sakamoto Days has shifted gradually to a more serialized plot, which is actually a shame; there's not much to the plot, but its one-and-done comedy ideas from week to week tend to be a lot of fun. Still, this is a really good series most weeks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>BUILD KING</strong><br><strong>18 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED NOVEMBER 2020</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/06-Build-King.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/06-Build-King-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/06-Build-King-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/06-Build-King-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/06-Build-King-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/06-Build-King-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/15/responsive/06-Build-King-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"600\"></figure>\n<p>I don't think I've ever seen something that is so specifically trying to copy One Piece. From the exaggerated art style, to the reckless optimism of its protagonist (who wants to be King, in this case of the builders rather than the pirates), even down to the specific way the protagonist's ranged attack is drawn, this is a series that saw One Piece about to pass its 1000 chapter mark and thought, how hard can it be?<br><br>Of course, something as monstrously popular as One Piece is extremely difficult to copy, and Build King definitely fails at it, and generally fails at being an entertaining series at all. But it's certainly a fascinating one. Our heroes are Tonkachi and Renga, two brothers who grew up on a desert island and learned how to build impressive dwellings for its animal inhabitants. Or rather, one of them learned how. Renga is a decent architect, but Tonkachi's enthusiasm often gets the better of him, and he'd much rather have fun smashing things with his hammer.<br><br>Both boys want to be master builders in a society that highly values architects that can do impossible things, and so the story follows them in their quest to become great architects. Along the way they encounter living house-beasts, a tournament designed to qualify builders with licenses, and dwellings that seem to be built impossibly.<br><br>There's some unique visuals in this series, and I'm particularly intrigued by the overly elaborate drawing style of the characters. It's a look that reminds me a bit of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, and it's clearly worked out well for the mangaka, who worked previously on a Jump series about a gourmet cook that ran in the magazine for nearly a decade in the 2010s. But this particular story really isn't doing it for me, and it's frequently my least favorite Jump series, except for weeks when Hard-Boiled Cop &amp; Dolphin is having a particularly incompetent week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>PHANTOM SEER</strong><br><strong>29 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED AUGUST 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I can forgive a series a lot of flaws if it has some interesting ideas that are well-executed. Phantom Seer doesn't have the most compelling of plots, exactly. Riku is a normal high school girl who meets Iori, a fellow student who exorcises spirits. The problem is, he'd rather just be a normal person. Thru their adventures together, Riku learns about her own supernatural powers as a Beckoning Hand, and Iori slowly learns to care about things again.<br><br>\"Plucky girl and stubborn dude\" is an extremely common duo in anime and manga. You can see it everywhere from Witch Watch in Jump, to the light novel series Haruhi Suzumiya. There's nothing wrong with using a well-established trope, but I think Phantom Seer's biggest flaw is the aimlessness of Iori's desires. If you compare this to Undead Unluck later on, which has a main character whose goal is to die, Iori doesn't really do much work to reach his goal. He just enters every action scene with a resigned tone, like he's saying \"mom, do I HAVE to?\"<br><br>But Phantom Seer is selling very well, and I'm not surprised. On a micro level, I think this series works great. There's a fun sequence that takes place within a mirror funhouse. There's a story arc where an old friend of Iori's shows up, and begins transforming into a half-phantom hybrid. The most recent storyline involves a villain who turns everybody into dolls. The concepts are a great mix of creepy and cool, and the art style emphasizes their grotesqueness beautifully.<br><br>Phantom Seer is created by a team of two: Togo Goto, who's writing his first Jump manga here, and Kento Matsuura, who previously illustrated Tokyo Shinobi Squad in Jump in 2019. At time of writing, Jump has announced the impending cancellation of Phantom Seer. I was disappointed at first, but I think Jump may have seen the fact that this series doesn't really work at its core on a long-term basis. I do hope to see these two working on another project in the future, because this has been a delight to read from week to week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>HIGH SCHOOL FAMILY</strong><br><strong>32 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED SEPTEMBER 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jump debuted a huge number of comedy manga last year. Some of them have since been cancelled, but many haven't. It felt overwhelming in 2020; now, the balance is a bit better. <br><br>I'll be honest, I don't really read Jump for the comedy series, so I didn't really care for most of the new comedy series that debuted last year, with a few exceptions. But all the ones that have stuck around have grown on me a little, including High School Family.<br><br>High School Family has a really simple premise: a boy goes to high school for the first time, and to his dismay, he's joined by his little sister, and their mother and father, and their cat. That's the sort of goofy premise where the jokes basically write themselves; the younger sister becomes the class' precocious genius, the mother bakes for everybody, the cat becomes the class mascot, and so on.<br><br>The boy, who's the only character who's the correct age (and species) for high school, is pretty understandably put off by all of this. But the more the series has gradually shifted focus away from him, the better it's gotten. Because at its heart, High School Family is a fish out of water story about a group of people in a situation they're not really prepared for. The more the story focuses on their struggles and their earnest attempts to fit in, the more the story's heart shines through.<br><br>The best character is easily the father. We get the most information on his backstory: he was part of a successful business and was all set up for a promotion, but decided to leave his job in order to fulfill his dream of attending high school. He gets the most characters from his past filtering back into the story, and he gets the most compelling arcs, such as when he tries out for the volleyball team but ends up becoming the team's errand boy.<br><br>It's not an amazing series, but as a comedy filler between the magazine's bigger series, it now fits perfectly, because it's not just cringe comedy anymore. It's an earnest story with heart and love, even if it's a weird one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>ME &amp; ROBOCO</strong><br><strong>35 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JULY 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Me &amp; Roboco is a comedy series about reading Shonen Jump. That seems obvious from its debut cover art, but it took me a while to figure out, and honestly I think it also took a while to crystalize in the plot. Going back to the earliest chapters, it took nearly a dozen chapters for Jump itself to start featuring heavily into the fabric of Me &amp; Roboco.<br><br>Me &amp; Roboco takes place an unknown period of time into the future in which everybody has their own robot maid. When kid protagonist Bondo's family finally gets one, the maid (named Roboco) is strangely different from everybody else's. She's differently shaped from other robot maids, and she seems to have no conception of how to do basic maid duties, like cooking a meal or cleaning a room.<br><br>Early on, the drama of each heavily gag-focused manga is about what you'd expect from that premise: where did Roboco come from, will she learn how to be a good maid, and will she and Bondo get along? There's a pretty solid supporting cast, including my favorite characters: a couple of bullies in Bondo's class who always turn their bullying around at the last moment into something super supportive. It's a really good joke every time.<br><br>As time goes on, we learn something really important about Bondo and his friendgroup: they're all huge fans of Shonen Jump. A lot of the jokes and plots in later chapters revolve around homages to classic and current Jump series. But the best chapters are about how Jump brings the friendgroup together in little ways, how the lessons of friendship inherent in most Jump series resonate out into the real world. For that reason, this is probably the most solid series Jump has that's purely comedy and has zero aspirations to be a serialized narrative. It fits the magazine perfectly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>HARD-BOILED COP &amp; DOLPHIN</strong><br><strong>36 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JUNE 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I already played my hand here earlier, but oh well: this series is a mess. Build King may be a ripoff, but I think this is my least favorite currently running Jump series both in conception and execution.<br><br>HBC&amp;D is about a cop named Boyle (cause he's hard-\"Boyle\"d, get it?) who's shipped off to a small island town as a punishment. His new partner is an anthropomorphic dolphin man named Orpheus, and Orpheus' young adoptive daughter Chako. Together, the three of them investigate crimes on the island, mostly perpetrated by other anthropomorphized sea creature immigrants from the surrounding waters (ugh), as well as a cult that lionizes the young Chako as their prophet, and keeps trying to kidnap her (also ugh).<br><br>Like, I dunno, I feel like just describing this manga's plot should be enough to explain why it's bad. It plays into the sorts of stereotypes that empower cops to commit horrible acts against citizens: all the criminals here are illegal immigrants and child-stealers. <br><br>At least with i tell c, another cop drama in Jump, the characters are less cop than they are detective, and there's a lot more empathy given to the criminals, and more shades of gray about the motives and methods of the police. Here, the conflicts are all very one-sided.<br><br>And it's not even GOOD copaganda! At least the most recent arc has devolved into a race for an ancient temple, like the series has turned into Indiana Jones. Most of the time, the writing is very boring and pedantic, there's way too much exposition, the characters are extremely unlikeable, and the art does not work. All of the character design is very lanky and one-note, and there's no real sense of action. This series can't get cancelled quickly enough.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>MAGU-CHAN: GOD OF DESTRUCTION</strong><br><strong>37 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JUNE 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Magu-chan was the first in a slew of comedy manga that came out last summer. At the time, I didn't really care for Magu-chan, because its premise seems shallow at first. But this is a surprisingly deep series that I've come to love dearly.<br><br>The plot of Magu-chan: God of Destruction kicks off when a young girl named Ruru, while digging for clams on the beach, finds a gem and accidentally unleashes an ancient spirit named Magu Menueku. Magu enjoyed a period of time on Earth as an all-powerful god of destruction, but there's a problem. With so much time sealed away, and his old cult dissolved, Magu arrives back on Earth as a tiny and underpowered octopus-like creature who nobody seems to remember.</p>\n<p>The good news for him - and Ruru - is that Ruru lives alone, and is happy to have a new friend. The two begin living together and bond over their shared experiences. Slowly over time, the cast grows larger, with both new human characters and new supernatural gods and spirits.<br><br>\"A human teaches a nonhuman creature how to exist in the real world\" is a fairly common trope; hell, it was even used in the first live-action Thor movie. What makes Magu-chan work so well for me is how much these two need each other. Ruru lives alone and needs a lot more support and friendship than she has, and Magu-chan needs followers to have any power. But since nobody in Ruru's friendgroup is willing to be a cult member, what that translates to here is that he needs friends.<br><br>Ruru's the heart of the series, especially as her friendgroup meets more and more nonhuman gods and spirits. She's extremely kindhearted and frequently forgets to think of herself, and part of her character arc is about learning how to be a little bit selfish and get more support. I found that extremely sweet and relatable.<br><br>There's one more bit of uniqueness that Magu-chan has going for it, and I suspect it's the main reason (along with the sweet heart at the series core) that the series has lasted so long. More than any other currently running series, Magu-chan celebrates the changing of the seasons. It's had chapters coinciding with Halloween, Valentine's Day, Christmas, spring break, and more. That's kind of an important staple for Jump, and no other series right now is really doing that.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>AYAKASHI TRIANGLE</strong><br><strong>38 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JUNE 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ayakashi Triangle is a genderbend manga. You should have a sense of whether you'd like this series from that short description, because that's pretty much the only card this series has to play. But it's a pretty good card.<br><br>In the first chapter, childhood friends Matsuri (an exorcist ninja) and Suzu (a spirit medium) go up against Shirogane, the King of Ayakashi. As they're about to defeat him, Shirogane laments that his defeat could cause the two childhood friends to become closer, and maybe even hook up. He casts a spell on Matsuri to change his gender, hoping that the two best friends both being girls will stop them from beginning a romantic relationship.<br><br>Incredibly, he's successful. Both Matsuri and Suzu feel weird about the idea of dating each other while they're both girls, but they also clearly have an affection for each other. So Matsuri works hard to get turned back into a boy, while Suzu learns about her own powers as a spiritual medium.<br><br>So yeah, there's really no getting around this: Ayakashi Triangle is horny. Easily the horniest series of the bunch, which Jump noticed, because it's the only series that you can't read thru the app; you have to read it thru a browser on a computer. It's actually a replacement for Jump's previous ecchi series (a term used for content that's sexually charged), Yuuna &amp; the Haunted Hot Springs, which ended right before this debuted last summer.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with a horny series; Ayakashi Triangle never has explicit content, and it still fits within the general tone of Jump. And as a transgender person, I'm a sucker for genderbend manga; I've read plenty of Ranma 1/2. But you'd kinda hope that a genderbend manga would have a little more to it than that, and Ayakashi Triangle really doesn't.<br><br>It does try. Just like Ranma 1/2, Ayakashi Triangle frequently adds new characters who could distract one or both of the leads from their relationship with each other, hence the title \"Ayakashi Triangle.\" But whereas Ranma had a believable web of characters and relationships, Matsuri and Suzu are too close with each other for distractions to be believable. <br><br>In addition, there's not much experimentation with the idea of Matsuri and Suzu loving each other as girls. And over time, Matsuri loses interest in turning back into a boy, and the plot's focus shifts to Suzu's powers and her role within the ayakashi world. The friends' relationship, which is the core of the series, kinda gets put on hold.<br><br>There's still some good magic and ayakashi action here, and the series is beautifully drawn by Kentaro Yabuki, who's done work on older long-running series Black Cat and To Love Ru. But Ayakashi Triangle definitely underwhelms me more often than I'd like.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>MASHLE: MAGIC &amp; MUSCLES</strong><br><strong>56 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JANUARY 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This one took me a couple tries to really get into, but now I definitely understand why this one is so popular. It's a pretty excellent series.<br><br>So here's the deal: Jump lost A LOT of its most popular long-running series last year, including Haikyu, The Promised Neverland, and Kimetsu no Yaiba. Jump's been keeping an eye out for up-and-comers that could potentially go the distance, and as a result, both Mashle and Undead Unluck (below) have received a pretty substantial marketing push. It seems to have worked; sales for the two series are good so far, which is helped by the series themselves being very very well done.<br><br>Mashle, like the anime Little Witch Academia before it, is a magical school series that seems to be a direct response to Harry Potter. This is most prominently reflected in the protagonist Mash's (fake) scar-shaped facial marking, and in the chapter titles and collection covers that echo elements of the Harry Potter series.<br><br>The premise is this: in a dystopian fantasy world, anybody without magical powers is killed by the government. The unmagical Mash Burnedead lives in the forest with his father, who has trained Mash so much that Mash now has incredible physical strength. When the government finds out about Mash and his father's magicless existence, they threaten to kill them both. Mash impresses them so much with his physical strength that the government official gives him an impossible task: go to magical school and become a Divine Visionary, and they'll allow him to live.<br><br>Class struggle is really the heart and soul of Mashle. Within the halls of the magical school (which is already a place in which the lowest class, nonmagical people, are banned from existence), the characters with the most social status and magical power are invariably rich upperclass snobs and assholes. Mash is an unstoppable force that pretty much nobody is ready to confront. Some befriend him, and others fight him, but pretty much nobody is able to really break him.<br><br>It's extremely cathartic, especially with how poorly Harry Potter has aged over time. A lot of the core elements that lead to the class struggle at this series' forefront are identical to Harry Potter: nonmagical people were banned from Hogwarts, and the main character of that series inherited a large fortune and was the child of two powerful and popular magic users. Only this time, characters like Harry Potter are usually the antagonists. The only main trait Mash shares with Harry is his close circle of friends.<br><br>I haven't seen this sort of direct response to Harry Potter stateside, but this is the second time I've seen a major mainstream Japanese series that's a direct response to and critique of Harry Potter. Just a few years ago, Little Witch Academia portrayed a magical school in which its bureaucracy and students were out of touch with society, its tech was out of date, and the relevance of magic was fading as a result. In that series, it also took a lower-class outsider to start really changing the system for the better. In Harry Potter, Hogwarts was a magical and wondrous place; in Little Witch and Mashle, the magical school is itself a major source of the series' conflict.<br><br>No wonder Mashle is popular, especially with how far J.K. Rowling has fallen in recent years. But here's what matters: this doesn't just work in response to Harry Potter, but on its own terms as well. Mashle is very funny, visually stunning, and frequently surprising. It has a fantastic cast of characters. It has the heart and determination that fuels the best of the Jump series. Mashle deserves to run for as long as the mangaka wants to write and draw it, and given the current state of Jump, I'd say it'll be around for a good while.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>UNDEAD UNLUCK</strong><br><strong>57 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED JANUARY 2020</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Undead Unluck is a straight-up fantastic series, and it's in close competition for my favorite series currently running in Jump. So far, only one other series (the next entry) is a strong contender.<br><br>18-year-old Fuuko Izumo has a strange power: anybody who touches her gets hit with a stroke of bad luck, often bad enough to injure or kill them. Having finished her favorite manga, she decides to kill herself. A strange man sees her about to jump and hears about her bad luck, and touches her in order to receive her bad luck. He immediately gets hit by a train, but it doesn't kill him; turns out he's an undead zombie, and he's looking for a way to get killed for real. The two (Undead and Unluck) embark on a quest to figure out how to help the zombie (who Fuuko names Andy) find a final death.<br><br>That's a pretty basic premise that doesn't necessarily seem like it could expand into a full-length series. Mangaka Yoshifumi Tozuka, who's done a few Jump one-shots and writes his first full series here, slowly expands the concept into something epic and heartfelt. This starts when Fuuko and Andy discover that there's other \"negators\" with strange supernatural abilities starting with the letters \"Un-\". <br><br>And if there's other people with abilties, of course there's groups of people with these abilities, like the Union. And if there's groups of people with these abilities, of course they're embarking on a quest to save the universe from total destruction by embarking on difficult sidequests to capture or kill other negators and embodied rules of the universe. ... Wait, what?<br><br>The writing of this series is SO SO GOOD. Nearly every character in its extensive cast is likeable and/or interesting, and the characters have great depth to them. The overarching plot, which deals with the strange way in which this world works, is fascinating to watch unfold.<br><br>If I have any qualms about the series, it's that it feels like the main characters don't drive the plot so much, but merely happen to be involved in it. That's not the case for the last entry on this list, in which the characters and the plot inform each other constantly. But it's a small quibble. Undead Unluck is cool, and it's gripping, and it's heartwrenching, and it's sweet, and it's fun. It's a top-tier Jump series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>MISSION: YOZAKURA FAMILY</strong><br><strong>76 CHAPTERS</strong><br><strong>DEBUTED AUGUST 2019</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I am completely blown away by how much I've turned around on this series. It easily takes the Most Improved Player award, and might be my favorite series currently running.<br><br>Taiyo and Mutsumi are childhood friends. Taiyo lost his family in a car accident somewhat recently, and Mutsumi has a large family of super-spies of all ages. When her overprotective brother Kyoichiro threatens to kill Taiyo for getting too close to Mutsumi, the other members of Mutsumi's family suggest an unusual plan: if Taiyo marries Mutsumi and becomes a family member, Kyoichiro will be unable to kill Taiyo because of the family rules that forbid killing other family members. Ultimately, Taiyo decides to marry Mutsumi after all, regaining the family that he lost in the car accident.<br><br>What follows is a spy manga that's structured like a gag manga. Nearly every chapter in the first 20-30 are self-contained stories with strong comedy elements, as Taiyo learns how to become a super-spy so he can protect his wife, and so he can hold his own in missions with his family members. However, because of the plot-heavy nature of the missions, each chapter has a lot more exposition than the average gag manga, so it takes a good deal of time to read.<br><br>Now, Yozakura Family is not the only Jump series to deal with a family of spies. Spy x Family, another currently running series that's exclusive to the Jump+ app, has been significantly more popular and better-selling than Yozakura Family. So I was curious as to why Mission: Yozakura Family has been allowed to run for over a year and counting.<br><br>Well, around the 30 chapter mark, this series really clicked for me. Things started coming together. Whereas the first bunch of chapters focuses on individual elements (a supporting character here, a subplot there), as the series gets closer to 40 chapters those elements start finally building to create a greater whole. The greater plot starts to get unveiled. The characters, which have now each been established and developed in earlier chapters spotlighting them, get to all work together.<br><br>And Mission: Yozakura Family reveals itself as having some of the deepest and richest emotion of any Jump series I've read so far. It's about being part of a family of weirdos, and loving and accepting all of them even with their strange traits. (Except for the ones that are actively harmful.) It's about the long-term effects of grief and trauma, and finding comfort and salvation in the love of the people around you. It's about two people, Taiyo and Mutsumi, in a beautiful mutually supportive relationship, and how they care for each other even when they don't know how.<br><br>Mission: Yozakura Family is cool and fun as hell, especially with all the weird superpowers and crazy situations the characters find themselves in on a regular basis. But what really tips it over the edge is an attention to character and a depth of emotion that's really unlike just about any manga series I've ever read. Mission: Yozakura Family is the real deal, and more people should read it.<br><br><br><br><br></p>",

Hopefully that won't happen again, but I wouldn't be surprised if it does. This project involves going thru a lot of games.<br><br>I strongly considered cancelling this project, just cause of how many games per month this project entails. But the thing is, I've found some of my favorite games ever in Humble, as you'll see below. So I do think it's worth keeping around for now.<br><br>With that preamble out of the way, here is a rundown of the games in Humble's monthly bundles for February 2021 and February 2016, ranked from best to worst.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>HUMBLE FEBRUARY 2021 BUNDLE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>1) Werewolf The Apocalypse: Heart of the Forest</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>This is the first game in any 2021 bundle that I've played thru to completion, just to give you a sense of how much I liked it.<br><br>Werewolf: The Apocalypse is a tabletop roleplaying game in the same universe as Vampire: The Masquerade. Both are storytelling-heavy systems in which you play as a member of a secret clan of monster people. These games are SO much more narratively-focused than Dungeons &amp; Dragons that it makes a lot of sense to translate these systems in a videogame sphere to something more linear like a visual novel.<br><br>Last month, VTM: Shadows of New York mixed good art and deep writing to create a rich visual novel experience. This month, WTA: Heart of the Forest is doing the same thing, but a little bit better.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>In both games, you play as a queer girl trying to find herself. Whereas in VTM: Shadows of New York you played as a down-on-her-luck investigative journalist, here you play as a girl just trying to find her heritage in the depths of Poland. Along with her friend, she travels to a town she's seen in her dreams, and the mystical forest and strange townspeople slowly help her understand her nature as a newborn werewolf.<br><br>One of my critiques of these visual novels is this: in translating a robust tabletop roleplay system, there's a lot of ideas and definitions the game needs to inorganically teach you. Shadows of New York did this by throwing definitions at you every couple of minutes, but Heart of the Forest solves this problem rather elegantly with its best gameplay decision: an honest-to-Gaia in-game character sheet.</p>\n<p>As you progress thru the game, the decisions you make slowly build your character sheet. Your relationship with various characters is recorded, as are all your stats. Depending on what actions you take, you can gain or spend points in all sorts of areas.<br><br>This also means that the game *feels* more interactive than Shadows of New York. I'm unsure how much your choices actually change the story, but the writing tweaks itself to what your character cares about and how they're feeling.<br><br>I dunno, something about the Werewolf setting, which is very much about being an environmental activist, resonates with me more than the Vampire setting, which is more generically about being part of a monstrous secret society. This game really grabbed me, I loved the main character I built, and it was a treat to see this story to the end. I'd happily play a sequel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>2) Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Trine-4-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>I'm sort of surprised they're still making Trine games. Trine has been around since the beginning of the indie boom in the late 2000s. It's a series of 2.5D puzzle platformers (that is, 2D platformers where the grapics are rendered in 3D). The third installment supposedly took a detour into 3D platforming, but after that was received poorly, Trine 4 is back to the 2.5D formula the series began with.<br><br>This is the only Trine game I've ever played with, so I can't really get a sense of how similar or different it is to the other games, or if the narrative really needed a fourth installment. Certainly the plot reads as a standalone \"our established heroes must embark on a one-and-done quest\" kind of thing.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Trine-4-gameplay-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>All I can tell you is that this game plays very well. The puzzle platforming is not terribly difficult, but it is very engaging. I keep wanting to play just a little bit more to see what's around the corner.<br><br>And it is a BEAUTIFUL game. Seriously, the art design in this game is absolutely stunning. Even if the game is a somewhat shallow experience, it's a very well-made shallow experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>3) Train Station Renovation</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Train-Station-Renovation-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>What is it with me and job simulator games? Train Station Renovation is a game in which you go to old decrepit train stations, and you clean them up.

The music's not as good, for one thing, and in a long meditative game that's an important factor. Also, the process of cleaning up a train station is somewhat inherently longer than that of cleaning up a PC, which means that I don't really see the game progress and evolve here. A single game session of Train Station Renovation will probably include only one station, whereas a single session of PC Building Sim could see me work with at least half a dozen computers.<br><br>But ultimately, none of that matters too much, because the gameplay loop of Train Station Renovation is just inherently deeply satisfying. It even lets you customize the look of your train stations!

You play as a small child, and your parent has brought you to the grocery store. Your job is to collect and purchase groceries, by yourself, for the first time ever. Once you've selected seven items, you can bring them to the register and pay for them.

If you wander around, you'll find other characters perusing the aisles. You can also find other secret areas, both inside and outside the building. All of these give you other characters to talk to, and little sidequests for you to try. You'll get a little reward to collect if you complete them.

And lo and behold, that worked way better. Maybe cause there's no way implemented to aim or lock-on with the boomerang, it's sort of frustrating to use as a throwing implement, and there's a lot less x-factor in a big brawl if you just run around and stab people.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>9) Lovecraft's Untold Stories</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>What if Spelunky was a top-down 2D exploration game, and also it was themed around Cthulhu cultists and other Lovecraft references?

It's not a huge surprise that somebody would try to copy it.<br><br>The basic idea behind Moving Out is \"Overcooked, but with moving.\" You can see on paper why this was an okay idea.

It took my girlfriend and me ages to successfully get a game started with each of us playing on half of the keyboard. </span></p>\n<p>Secondly, there's just not much of a cooperative element to this game. In Overcooked, different people will take different jobs because of how spread out the resources are: chopping, dishwashing, cooking, serving, etc. Moving Out doesn't really have that. You move your own items until you get to a piece of furniture that needs two people, and then you ask your friend \"hey come help me with this,\" and then you move it outside and go back to what you were doing before.<br><br>The basic goal of a level is to fit everything into the moving truck, and this is where the game really fails. Again, you can sort of see the logic, but the physics really don't let you place the furniture carefully at all. You just sort of throw it into the truck, and hope that once you get to the end of the level, you'll be able to slam the door closed.<br><br>This game was not fun at all.

Maybe because I love the original Alien film so much. You play as Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Alien's protagonist Ellen Ripley. Amanda learns that a space station called Sevastopol may have information regarding her mother's disappearance, so she ventures there to find out. Of course the space station is overrun with xenomorphs and evil androids, and it's up to Amanda to find what she's looking for and escape unharmed.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Alien-Isolation-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Alien-Isolation-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Alien-Isolation-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Alien-Isolation-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Alien-Isolation-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Alien-Isolation-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Alien-Isolation-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>T<span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">his game is now 7 years old and the graphics are still amazing. They really nail the look of a 70s horror movie. The gameplay itself is hard, but generally pretty fair. The alien's AI is really fun to play with; it feels like a dance, keeping an eye and ear out for it while trying to navigate around the station. At times, the game resembles a blockbuster action movie, especially towards the end, but the pacing is so good that it really deserves the ramp up.</span></p>\n<p>I think the most impressive part of this game is how it programs you. The most interesting antagonist of the game is actually Sevastopol Station itself, a decaying wreck full of capitalist propaganda. This game is full of little contextual button prompts for mechanics like starting up a generator or welding thru a locked door, but they're repeated so often that you end up memorizing them, and rotely performing the tasks like you're a worker on Sevastopol yourself. It's one of the most fascinating reactions to a game I've ever had, and really resonates great with the anti-corporate story.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>2) Broken Age</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Broken-Age-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>This game received a pretty mixed reception when it first came out.

It's not a very elegantly designed videogame.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>7) Titan Souls</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Titan-Souls-title.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-title-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-title-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-title-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-title-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-title-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-title-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Here we are, Titan Souls. How far the mighty have fallen. I think this game was really well received, years and years ago. Certainly I remember it being... at least intriguing, although I never got very far. This is a pixelly indie game, very much in the style of early indie games like Fez and Superbrothers, in which you play a small warrior with a bow and arrow, trying to destroy several bosses. There is no level design outside the bosses. It's just a boss rush game.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Titan-Souls-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>So those bosses gotta be pretty well-designed for this to work, and let me tell you, I could not finish a single boss in this game. Your movement controls don't work great, and you have to summon your single arrow back to you every time you fire it. You also only have a single hit point; if you get hit once, you die and have to try the boss again. If you're really good at boss fights, this might be for you, but it's way too difficult for me.</p>\n<p> </p>",

I have generally not loved his run on Uncanny, which tends to focus on smaller moments with a small group of characters. I think his writing is stiff and his plots are boring. But then I remembered that Uncanny was the title that did a focus issue on the mutant healer Cecilia Reyes, one of my favorite characters in the current X-Men team. And he forwarded the plot of the X-Men titles by depicting the trial of Gambit in Antarctica. And his one-off story about Jean &amp; Grey fighting a psychic force on an airplane was pretty fun. Uncanny's had some lows (I really didn't care for the number of times it encouraged me to go read Seagle's other book, Alpha Flight), but it's had some decent stuff too.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Untold Tales of Spider-Man: Strange Encounter #1</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/Untold-Tales-of-Spider-Man-Strange-Encounter-1.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Untold-Tales-of-Spider-Man-Strange-Encounter-1-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Untold-Tales-of-Spider-Man-Strange-Encounter-1-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Untold-Tales-of-Spider-Man-Strange-Encounter-1-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Untold-Tales-of-Spider-Man-Strange-Encounter-1-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Untold-Tales-of-Spider-Man-Strange-Encounter-1-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Untold-Tales-of-Spider-Man-Strange-Encounter-1-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"342\" height=\"522\"></figure>\n<p>Here's an oversized one-shot meant to briefly take the place of the recently-cancelled series \"Untold Tales of Spider-Man,\" which featured side stories from early in Spider-Man's career.

I like him, he's generally pretty entertaining, and so is Werewolf By Night. As with Man-Thing, the art is dark and twisted and evocative, and it all illustrates a story where the titular monstrous protagonist must go on a journey to find a bunch of McGuffins in different places. There's a sequence in the middle where werewolf Jack Russell takes a carnival ride to Hell and confronts his inner demons, which is really strong stuff.</p>\n<p>Of course the series ends on a cliffhanger, and curiously with the same plot beat that vampire Hannibal King faced in Journey Into Mystery: Jack wakes up to find that he's killed somebody for the first time ever. Kinda feels like that should have come up at some point before in this character's long history?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>What If vol 2 #105-111</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/What-If-v2-105.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-105-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-105-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-105-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-105-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-105-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-105-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"258\" height=\"396\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/What-If-v2-106-111.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-106-111-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-106-111-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-106-111-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-106-111-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-106-111-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/What-If-v2-106-111-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2506\" height=\"642\"></figure>\n<p>I started reading with an issue I was really excited for - Tom DeFalco wrote issue #105, which introduces May Parker, the alternate-reality daughter of Peter Parker and Mary Jane. In this issue, she takes up her father's legacy and becomes the new Spider-Girl. Much like Amazing Fantasy, this issue would become so popular that it would spin off into its own series, which would launch later in 1998.<br><br>None of the other issues of What If that I've read reach that high bar, but many come close. I've previously read a few issues of What If from the mid-2000s, and they tend to be pretty dark. But here, What If refuses to ignore these characters' essential goodness and the hope that they represent. <br><br>In one issue, DeFalco wonders what would happen if the X-Men were harder on Gambit after he betrays the team. In the end, they're unable to truly hurt him because he's still their friend. In another issue, Apocalypse turns Wolverine into a brainwashed villain, inadvertently creating an enemy large enough to rally the world against him and bring about an everlasting peace. But that doesn't end in Wolverine's death; it's revealed that he broke free of the brainwashing and is searching for his own inner peace.<br><br>Of course some issues are downers, but in those cases it kinda feels like the characters had it coming. Perhaps the most tragic issue of this bunch is the one starring the Fantastic Four, in which the Thing decides to abandon his teammates for a happy life with Alicia Walters in a tiny villain-created utopia, ignoring the battle they must face and lying to Alicia about the true nature of their peace. The story ends with his teammates dead, Alicia distraught, and the Thing trapped in his false utopia, giving him karmic retribution for his actions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Wolverine vol 2 #119-127, Annual 1997</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/Wolverine-v2-119-127-Annual-1997-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"3216\" height=\"1964\"></figure>\n<p>Even before the X-Men movie in 2000, Wolverine is one of Marvel's most popular characters. So with a Wolverine series, Marvel can do pretty much anything they want. What they've elected to do here is give the reins to a new writer every story arc.<br><br>Warren Ellis takes the first four issues, a tale called \"Not Dead Yet\" which sees Wolverine tracking down and fighting a murderous asshole he used to go drinking with. The dialogue is sparse but the writing is *on point* and Leinil Yu's art is bold, so it's kinda one of my favorite self-contained arcs I've read in this project.<br><br>After a brief interlude from John Ostrander &amp; Joe Edkin for the annual (it's pretty good, it focuses on Wolverine's ability to lose control), Tom DeFalco takes the reins for a couple of one-off issues. The first one pits him against Roughouse and Bloodscream, two villains DeFalco also used over in Amazing Spider-Man. I don't know why DeFalco cares about them, they're pretty boring. The second is a crossover with Captain America. Both are fine.<br><br>Then Chris Claremont takes over, and... y'know, Claremont's praised as one of the best X-Men writers of all time, but between this and his work over in Fantastic Four this year, I really do not see it. The plot is that Wolverine's been manipulated into making good on a promise he made to marry Viper. Several of the women in his life try to stop him, and Kitty Pryde sticks around for the immediate fallout. It's kind of gross? I mean, Kitty's one of my favorite characters, I'm all for seeing her in more comics, but she kinda just gets used by the villain here, and Viper is just a bitch. And the story's super unfocused too, Wolverine takes an entire issue to mess with some Hydra goons for reasons seemingly unrelated to the main story.

There really wasn't a perfect jumping-on point for me to start reading this series cause it's all kind of a mess, so I did the best I could and read these nine issues. <br><br>Maybe the biggest problem of the main stuff is that I just don't care about the main cast. Wildchild, Dark Beast, Alex Summers, and Polaris are all kinda boring. Even Madrox doesn't manage to make things much better in his one appearance. It's a shame because series writer Howard Mackie is also working on adjectiveless Spider-Man, and he's doing a much better job over there. Maybe he was just dealt a bad hand.<br><br>The biggest plot-related thing that happens is a group of mutants from the future called the Xavier Underground Enforcers (not to be confused with the group they split off from, the Xavier Security Enforcers) arrive in the present in the bodies of new people whose identities they've now erased. There's some business where the characters visit the old lives of the people they've bodysnatched and try to make things better, but it's pretty messy.<br><br>The highlight of the series so far might be #147, written by guest writer Joseph Harris, about the mutant Shard trying to help out a bullied kid whose classmates think he's a mutant. Once he finds out he's not a mutant but is actually just double-jointed, he joins in with his classmates to bully Shard.

At the point when I started reading, X-Force decided they wanted to do their own thing, and Cable left to have adventures on his own.<br><br>So now X-Force, written almost entirely by John Francis Moore, is the slightly older edition of Generation X: a group of young people dealing with things separately from the main X-Men cast. While Gen X focuses on the whimsy of children, the X-Force team deals with plots and themes more appropriate for its slightly older cast in their teens and 20s. X-Force goes on a road trip, visits a Woodstock-esque festival, and grapples with their inner demons. Warpath has an extended arc in which he seeks out the people who massacred his village, gets killed, and is resurrected. Then Sunspot has a few issues in which he deals with a darker version of himself, Reignfire, who claims to be the same person as Sunspot and briefly possesses him.<br><br>Like with X-Factor, it could be a cast thing, where they haven't really chosen characters that I care about. Maybe if I'd been following since this team debuted in New Mutants Vol 1, I'd be more emotionally invested. I like Domino, but her subplot only shows up every so often.<br><br>It could also be that these characters have enough wealth and power that it doesn't really feel like they're struggling. They go on a cross-country trip without much trouble, and their funding being cut off is only a brief problem. The book just feels kind of dated (which the Woodstock bash doesn't help), and the characters are unlikeable and unrelatable.

Only Elektra managed to beat it out at the last minute.<br><br>For a start, it's a grim gritty superhero being really really angsty about how cursed he is to have all these superpowers and be such a beloved figure. Literally, there's an arc about halfway thru this stretch where Nate's really angsty about that, and then the Purple Man proves him right by manipulating people to first love him and then hate him. Oh my gods, get over yourself.<br><br>But that's not what makes this series so bad. What I absolutely loathed was how it treats characters with mental illness. In two cases, with the villains Hybrid and Jackknife, Nate makes them more mentally unstable with his psychic powers. Rather than helping them, Nate just hits them for a while until they stop fighting him, either because of serious bodily harm or flat-out disintegration. Nate doesn't really come to terms with what he's done and certainly doesn't seek to make amends. It's just presumed that we won't sympathize with the ultimate fate of the villains because they're, well, *crazy*. And this isn't some kind of undetailed undescribed insanity, either - these characters have clear cases of multiple personality disorder, repression, and schizophrenia. And these characters are left to suffer, even more than before Nate interacted with them. Writer Terry Kavanagh should be ashamed of this work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>X-Man &amp; Incredible Hulk Annual 1998</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Man-Incredible-Hulk-Annual-1998-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"469\" height=\"361\"></figure>\n<p>This annual is better than the X-Man ongoing because Hulk is in it, mostly calling the shots, and because the villain isn't a mentally ill person but fucking Thanos, still trying to break out of his cosmic prison from the Ka-Zar series.

From month to month, its cast is the main group of X-Men hanging out at the mansion, which is stronger than Uncanny's approach because the main team has a few unusual characters that shake up the dynamic a bit. Specifically, Marrow and Maggot and Cecilia Reyes are all relatively new additions to the team, and a lot of the drama involves them trying and occasionally failing to fit in with their peers.<br><br>Appropriately, this title is also where we get more relevant plot developments. The mutant following the X-Men around who thinks he's a reformed Magneto finds out he's actually somebody else. (This will come back around in an event in a few months.) A call for help that brings Storm and the X-Men to Africa results in Psylocke setting off a massive psychic trap, which is felt by several characters across titles such as X-Man and Generation X. <br><br>It feels like, if you wanted to follow just one X-book to know what was going on at the time, this would be the one you'd pick up. And I really liked it. I think Joe Kelly takes the time he needs to flesh out characters - little interactions like Wolverine bonding with Maggot and Angel talking down Marrow are pretty heartwarming, cause it feels like they're being brought into the fold even tho both Marrow and Maggot look pretty gross and feel like they're outcasts. But then Kelly also folds these into larger plot beats; the oversized 75th issue shows them tracking down the murderers who framed Maggot, and it's an appropriate catharsis given how much Maggot's struggled throughout the course of this title.<br><br>So not only is this the essential X-book to read if you only wanted to read one X-book in 1998, but it's my pick for the best of the X-books. All of the other series feel compromised in some way, but X-Men managed to make me love characters I'd never heard of before with kinda gross powersets. That's what X-Men should be at its best - a family where you weren't expecting one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>X-Men &amp; Alpha Flight vol 2 #1-2</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/13/responsive/X-Men-and-Alpha-Flight-v2-1-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"614\" height=\"471\"></figure>\n<p>Because Marvel loves Alpha Flight, here's another X-Men / Alpha Flight crossover, an untold story from early in both team's runs.

It doesn't have any immediate consequences in the X-books, but it looks like she's going to stick around.<br><br>Issue #18 has much more immediate and interesting consequences. The B-story is about Marrow, and shows what she's up to when she steals away from the main group of X-Men and hides out in the sewers. It's a really good way of setting up what's going on with her before Angel ultimately confronts her in the main X-books, and made me care just that little bit more about her character.<br><br>The A-story is about Gambit, and the immediate fallout of the X-Men abandoning him in Antarctica. This hit shelves very close to the time when What If did a feature on an alternate reality in which the X-Men swore vengeance against him, and between these two issues, I'm actually pretty hyped to see what'll happen to Gambit next. That may have been the design, because Gambit has an ongoing series that launches later in 1998. But hey, if it works it works.

In 2012, a friend told me about a bundle of games, some of which I'd heard were modern classics, being sold for very cheap. All of them could run on my underpowered laptop. That bundle was Humble Indie Bundle V.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/humbleindiebundleV-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/humbleindiebundleV-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"433\" height=\"615\"></figure>\n<p>This was Humble's fifth major project (but 13th overall) bringing together a group of games under a low price to raise money for charity. Pretty much every game in this bundle is fantastic: Psychonauts, Bastion, Amnesia, Limbo, Braid, Superbrothers... it's a gold mine.<br><br>Indie Bundle V was also a good representation of the indie game development boom that began around that time. Thanks to the Xbox 360 and the Steam game store on PC, indie developers had new places to showcase their work. Humble and the indie boom kind of walked hand-in-hand for the next decade; Humble kept bringing together bundles of notable indies, along with the occasional blockbuster title.<br><br>Towards the end of 2015, Humble started another project: a subscription service that provided a grab bag of games every month. It's legitimately a great way to try out some underappreciated games. But here's the thing: I've been subscribed to Humble Monthly for years, but I've been really bad about actually playing the games. I figured it was time for that to change.<br><br>More recently, the Humble Monthly Bundle has required subscribers to choose which games from the bundle to play, rather than giving subscribers all the games. It'd be helpful if there was somebody talking about which games are actually worth playing, wouldn't it?<br><br>SO. This, the latest project of Project-Topia, has two goals every month.<br><br>1) Firstly and most importantly, this overview will rank and review every game in the most recent Humble Monthly Bundle every month. Hopefully this will give subscribers and non-subscribers alike a sense of what all these games are, and whether they're worth picking up.<br><br>2) Secondly, I'm going to be reviewing one retro Humble Bundle every month. For now, that's going to be whatever monthly bundle happened five years ago this month. So this month, I'll be reviewing the January 2021 and January 2016 bundles.<br><br>Everybody following that?

I figured I'd try this once, get the gist, and that'd be enough.<br><br>Out of all the games on this list, I've easily put the most time into PC Building Sim. Several evenings' worth. Cause it's not what I thought it was. I figured it'd be, like, a tool. If you wanted to build a gaming PC, then PC Building Sim could sort of point you in the right direction, or you could pretend to have a nicer PC by playing the game.

People email you with requests, and then send you their desktop PCs to fix, clean, and upgrade. Eventually, people start asking you to build PCs for them, but not until you put a fair bit of time into the game. Every in-game day you come into work, check your email for new jobs, order new parts for the jobs, and then get to work fixing the PCs that have come in.<br><br>Some of the game is automated; you're not required to know exactly which cable should go where. On the other hand, the game won't let you give the fixed PC back until you've put all the parts in, either, so there's a little bit to learn. You also have to figure out when parts will be compatible with each other. <br><br>It's very easy to get into a routine with this game. It's quite soothing. The in-game radio selection is great, too. I was reminded of Euro Truck Simulator 2. That game does have trucks in it, yes, but it's a compelling long-term experience because you're expected to grow your business with the jobs that you take. Same goes for PC Building Sim: if you only do an okay job, you'll just get PCs that need to be dusted out and de-virused, and it gets boring fast. But if you give your customers amazing service, your rating will go up and you'll start getting new things to do.<br><br>It did not escape me that it was a little weird coming off work in the evenings and booting up PC Building Sim, which is basically another work simulator.

I think Papers Please was perhaps a bit more polished. This game asks you to switch between different gigs, and each gig has different requirements. You also get to spend time at home each day. Papers Please omitted those two things, and instead focused on a really polished and slowly escalating gameplay loop.<br><br>But it's not a bad thing to be a little rougher around the edges. The story of the game is sort of sad and pretty relatable, and I dig it. The pixel art is GORGEOUS. (Gorgeous art is sort of a theme in this bundle.) The music, overheard from each club you stand outside, is wonderful. Not Tonight is a bit more about your story than Papers Please, which was more about the stories of the people around you.

But here's the thing: it does work. It's VERY pretty - somebody put a lot of money into the graphics. I guess the Warhammer brand has deep pockets.

You play with a fixed camera, similar to the Resident Evil and Silent Hill games from the late 90s and early 00s. The game takes place in an old mansion, and you play as one of several different characters investigating the mansion and its inhabitant's recent disappearance.<br><br>Song of Horror was funded thru Kickstarter by a small indie developer from Spain. There is clearly a lot of love for old horror games in the DNA of this game. The idea of selecting your character is interesting, as is the fact that if your character dies, it's for permanent, and you must select another character to continue. Good *ideas* here.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble10-SongOfHorror-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><br>I heard an axiom once that if a game is fun to control, then it's fun to play.

It's hard to figure out the puzzles in the gloom of the poorly-lit mansion. It's not a very fun area to move around in, and your character has no personality.<br><br>I placed the game this high because, well, maybe there's somebody that this game is for.

This is effectively how you move around: erase part of the mold, thus forcing the mold to regrow in the direction you want it to go.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/Humble02-Mushroom11-gameplay.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-gameplay-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/12/responsive/Humble02-Mushroom11-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><br>Surely, somebody came up with this method of gameplay first, and then figured out what to do with it second.

Reading books is usually pretty hard for me, but one book a month? That I can do, especially when the list of books I've been wanting to read has grown so much over the last year or so.<br><br>I'm starting with The Lightning Thief, the first in Rick Riordan's multi-series franchise, published in 2005. Now, I have read this book before, when my sister had the original hardcover printing on her shelf. But at the time, I wasn't intending to read further. This time, I'm interested in the full series. <br><br>The Lightning Thief kicks off a five-book series called Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians, a modern YA take on Greek mythology. It's followed by two sequel series, and Rick Riordan has since branched out into writing trilogies about Egyptian and Norse mythology. He's also brought other writers in to write books inspired by mythology from at least a dozen other sources, from Aztec to Santeria. It's a fascinating spread that I'm eager to dig into.<br><br>The original book doesn't yet betray these ambitions. The Lightning Thief came right in the middle of what I remember as a scramble to find the next Harry Potter series. Alongside The Lightning Thief came the Charlie Bone books (2002), the Artemis Fowl series (2001), Eragon (2002), the Bartimaeus trilogy (2003), and for adults, Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell (2004) and Lev Grossman's The Magicians (2009).<br><br>It has almost the same initial structure as Harry Potter. Percy Jackson is a teenager who constantly seems to get into trouble (or, as he would describe it, trouble finds him). On a fateful stormy night, he's whisked away from his abusive family into a school for magic. He soon begins a quest alongside his two new best friends: a brainy girl, and a boy who is frequently the comedic relief.<br><br>There's wrinkles to this formula that are better than Rowling's Potter series. I don't remember the last time I read a series, for kids no less, where the main character is mentally disabled. Percy Jackson has ADHD and dyslexia, and this comes up regularly, first as a weakness in the mundane world, and then as a strength in the magical one. The closest to this that I can remember reading is the critically acclaimed \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\" which was very much *about* the main character's autism. Here, Percy has these mental illnesses, it is something that he wrestles with, but it's far from the book's focus.<br><br>I think, for what it's worth, Riordan is better than Rowling at writing a supporting cast that all seem to have their own agendas. Outside of Harry, we didn't really get a sense of what Ron and Hermione and the others around him hoped for and were striving for; they kind of got pulled along for the ride. Here, Percy's two friends have goals of their own, and they interweave with the main storyline in interesting ways. Grover, a satyr who's been tasked with looking out for Percy, wishes to prove himself so that he can begin an ancient quest to find the deity of the satyrs, Pan. Annabeth, daughter of Athena, longs for adventure, and uses Percy's quest as an excuse to find some. And it's not just these two: every minor character seems to have an agenda of their own, regardless of their position in the story. Rowling was good at writing character's affects, but Riordan is better at suggesting his characters' inner lives.<br><br>Now, a word about the depiction of the Greek mythological figures, places, and situations that the kids find themselves running into. They are okay. It's really not my favorite \"it's the gods but now it's contemporary\" depiction I've ever seen. The Wicked + The Divine, a favorite graphic novel of mine, did an amazing job. The video game Hades, last year, did an amazing job. American Gods, a mid-2000s novel by Neil Gaiman, did a pretty good job. I feel like some of the depictions here could be just a bit more inspired. The land of the Lotus Eaters, from The Odyssey, is now a Vegas casino. Ares is now a biker, and Poseidon is a surfer dude. It does work, but it feels like sometimes Riordan is going for the most obvious \"the gods, but now it's modern\" example he can think of.<br><br>But there's touches I do like, and the overall cosmology of the series is built on rock-solid ground. As the demigod trainer Chiron explains partway into the book, gods are egregoric beings, and thus can't really die. They just move to wherever the heart of Western civilization, as the world sees it, exists at any given time. So, Mount Olympus now resides in New York City, and the entrance to the Underworld can be found in - where else? - Los Angeles.<br><br>So with that in mind, here's why, to me, The Lightning Thief ultimately works really really well. Cause, yeah, in basic structure, it starts out as almost a clone of Harry Potter. Just because Percy ends up in a summer camp rather than a boarding school doesn't mean the similarities aren't there. But the further into the book you go, the more those similarities fall away. Percy and his friends don't stay at the school once the call to adventure reaches them. They take a road trip, and encounter more and more elements of classic mythology that now reside in America. One sidequest is a direct reference to Hephaestus finding Ares and Aphrodite sleeping together, in which the gods involved try to change the outcome of that story by using our three heroes as bait. At another point, the kids find and slay Medusa. The arrival at the Lotus Hotel &amp; Casino really tips you off to what's going on. The Lightning Thief has ceased to be a Harry Potter book, and is now a direct reference to stories of heroic quests across the Greek mythological landscape, such as The Odyssey and Perseus.<br><br>By the end, when Percy and his friends are confronting gods and villains in order to finish off the story, it feels like a clash of narrative titans. What happens when you take the \"kids go to magic school\" story - which by 2005 was already a well-established story - and bring them into conflict with mythological narratives? Well... both end up being changed in really interesting ways. The Lightning Thief doesn't really end in a way that's satisfying for either a Harry Potter story or a Greek myth, instead coming to an interesting and somewhat anticlimactic compromise. And with a group of characters that are already this rock-solid, it makes me think further books in the series are going to be even more interesting. We've done The Odyssey now - what's next?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>GRAPHIC NOVELS</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Shadow of the Batgirl</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-cover.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-cover-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-cover-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-cover-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-cover-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-cover-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-shadowofthebatgirl-cover-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"415\" height=\"623\"></figure>\n<p>Batman is only as interesting as the people around him.

Cassandra escapes her abusive father and winds up in a library, where she overhears Barbara Gordon (formely Batgirl, but now in a wheelchair for reasons not brought up in this comic) talking about heroism. With the help of Barbara, and a ramen store owner named Jacqueline, Cassandra figures out how to build herself up, learn who she wants to be, and eventually take on the mantle of Batgirl.<br><br>There's not very many details to pick thru in this book; it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from that premise. But I can't say enough good things about it. The art is gorgeous, flowy and full of character in every panel. Cassandra's struggles as she learns to communicate with other people are depicted with a lot of heart. The action is amazingly good.<br><br>I've said a lot of times how I think the superhero genre works well with the teenage coming-of-age story common in YA books. This is a really good example of that. Cassandra coming into her own and crafting a new identity for herself works great for both genres, and is the basis for an absolutely beautiful graphic novel.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>The Witch Boy</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-thewitchboy-cover.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-cover-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-cover-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-cover-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-cover-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-cover-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-thewitchboy-cover-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"404\" height=\"605\"></figure>\n<p>Towards the end of the month, Netflix announced an animated film adaptation of The Witch Boy, a graphic novel from Molly Knox Ostertag.

Aster is never explicitly called transgender, but he is clearly gender-nonconforming. Aster doesn't have a traditionally masculine or feminine name; \"Aster\" is a genus of flower, the sort of gender-ambiguous noun that I've seen in many of my nonbinary friends. His visual appearance also leans feminine: long ponytail, light purple clothing. Most importantly, over and over in the narrative it's reinforced that Aster feels more comfortable in the girls' group. I wish the story had gone just one step farther and actually used trans-positive language, but it's still a deeply powerful story about being who you are, even when everyone around you tells you no.

It's sort of meant as a deconstruction of the concept, but it accidentally introduced the term to more people outside of Japan, including myself.

He quickly comes into conflict with Rikka Takanashi, a high school freshman who still believes she has magical powers, including a \"Wicked Eye.\" Yuta is embarrassed by Rikka, but the two end up spending a lot of time together, slowly warming to each other, and bringing each further into the other's world.

Even though our POV character Yuta is embarrassed about his past chunibyo life, the show really isn't embarrassed about the concept at all. When Rikka and other characters go to great lengths to play pretend, we do get some cutaways showing what's actually going on, but we also get some lovely and frequently over-the-top animation showing the world they're seeing.<br><br>And what Yuta learns over time is that there's a really good reason Rikka's still a chuuni. The more time Yuta spends with Rikka and her sister, the more he learns that Rikka went thru some deeply traumatizing experiences, and chunibyo helped her cope and try to move on. When Yuta and Rikka ultimately fall in love, he still gets embarrassed about her over-the-top displays sometimes, but he takes part in her delusions almost as frequently. Rikka's imagination is treated as a beautiful and important part of her.<br><br>So yeah, this show is silly. But it's also sweet, it has a wonderful cast and a light tone, and it's a great story about the power of imagination. I haven't quite finished it - along with two full seasons, there's two films and a couple dozen shorts.

It's been a great way to start my Friday mornings.<br><br>In the four episodes that have aired to date (nearly half the series), the witch Wanda Maximoff and android Vision find themselves in the world of a sitcom from the mid 20th century. Each episode echoes a new decade: so far we've seen takes on I Love Lucy (the 50s), Bewitched (the 60s), and The Brady Bunch (the 70s). Wanda and Vision don't seem to realize that they're actually Avengers from the 21st century; they play their parts as the two leads of this constantly-evolving sitcom.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-WandaVisionimage-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"906\" height=\"669\"></figure><br>Except, they sort of do realize they're out of place. There's a lot of recurring plot elements, within the sitcom, about Wanda and Vision trying to fit in. Both characters retain their identities as a witch and a robot, two nonhuman people trying to fit in in a very mundane world. In the first episode, Vision tries to convince his boss that he's worth keeping around via a fancy home-cooked dinner; in the second episode, Wanda and Vision try to put on a magic show without revealing that they have actual magic powers. On its own terms, it's legitimately clever stuff.<br><br>And then the cracks start to show. Of course, the audience knows that something's very wrong, so it's a matter of time before Wanda and Vision, and even the people around them, start to realize that this sitcom world isn't real, or at least is hiding some sort of secret. How those cracks reveal themselves is part of the fun of the show, and there's a LOT to theorize about, whether you're a fan of the comics or not. I've got some pretty good guesses as to where this is all leading, but there's still a fair few elements that haven't fallen into place yet. <br><br>The whole thing is a LOT of fun - as a throwback sitcom, as a mystery, as the latest element of the Marvel Cinematic/(Televisual?) Universe. We've got as many as ten projects in the MCU planned for this year, and I couldn't be more excited.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>MOVIES</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Tenet</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-Tenettitle.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenettitle-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenettitle-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenettitle-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenettitle-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenettitle-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenettitle-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1210\" height=\"572\"></figure>\n<p>I can't help but feel that this movie would have been received better if everybody had been able to see it at once. Tenet was originally scheduled for a summer 2020 release. At Nolan's insistence, it was finally released in theaters towards the end of August, received a DVD and digital purchase release around Christmas, and only now - at the beginning of January - did it FINALLY receive a non-cost prohibitive rental release date. So only now are most people actually finally seeing it.<br><br>Here's the thing about Tenet: for me, this film works best in Youtube clip form. That isn't the insult that it may seem to be. I mentioned in my best of the year list for 2020 that Youtube clips of The Good Place finally convinced me to go back and finish that show. Tenet is the sort of film that BEGS to be analyzed and picked apart, so that people can actually understand what's going on. I have now seen countless Youtube clips explaining the events of the film in every possible way, and it took all of that analysis for me to basically understand the plot.<br><br>At the VERY least, with how bad the sound mixing is, you need captions to understand the film. And it certainly helps not to be sitting in a theater, anxious for two and a half hours about the possibility of catching a deadly disease.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-Tenetimage2.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage2-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1212\" height=\"552\"></figure><br>Let's strip away the pretension inherent in a Christopher Nolan movie to talk about this film for a second, in as basic terms as possible. Tenet is a time travel movie. Nolan's been trying to talk around this genre designation in just about all the marketing I've seen. It's presented as a movie about \"time inversion.\" Nah, bullshit. This movie only starts making a lick of sense when you start understanding it as a time travel movie.<br><br>Imagine for a second that Marty McFly got into the Delorean in Back to the Future and activated its time travel device. But instead of sending him to a specific point in the timeline, Marty and the Delorean started moving backwards in time, at the same rate that they were previously moving forwards in time. That's what time inversion is. It's time travel, at a rate of one second per second, in the opposite direction you were previously going. It does let you get to other points on your timeline, just very slowly. That's all it is.<br><br>I watched this movie with my roommates, and the first night we only got thru half of it before we couldn't watch any more, because of how boring it was. The next night, we picked it up at the halfway point, a climactic car chase. And what do you know, the halfway point is where the film gets GOOD, especially since by that point, I'd spent a lot of time on Youtube learning about the mechanics of the time inversion. It really did help to have at least one person in the room actually understanding what was going on.<br><br>The premise is, our hero, pretentiously named \"The Protagonist,\" is brought into a secret society to investigate the origins of a number of objects (mostly weapons) that have been \"inverted\" in time. These objects don't move thru time the way most people do, but originated from the future and are now moving backwards in time. The secret society believes that these objects are from a war in the future.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-Tenetimage.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Tenetimage-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1202\" height=\"668\"></figure><br>Okay, so, now ignore all that. The plot is bad. And also, it doesn't matter. It's an excuse, even within the story, to get the characters to the places they need to be for some cool stuff to happen. There's a car chase, a fistfight, a large-scale battle. It WOULD be your basic action movie stuff, but Nolan uses every opportunity to film things in reverse, which creates a lot of visual interest and excitement - even the things you've seen before, you're never quite sure how they're gonna go. I mean that in multiple senses.<br><br>Look: this movie isn't great. It's not close to Nolan's best work. But I've gotten less enjoyment out of Nolan movies before. I thought Dunkirk was sort of boring, and Interstellar kind of lost me. As a puzzle to unwind, Tenet is fun, and I'll be honest: there aren't a lot of blockbusters out there that present themselves as puzzles to unwind. The final action sequence of the movie has editing that reminds me strongly of my favorite webcomic, Homestuck, which is known for its experimental storytelling and non-chronological shenanigans. I'm not saying I got a lot out of this movie... but I honestly did get a fair bit of fun out of it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Promare</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-Promaretitle.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Promaretitle-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Promaretitle-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Promaretitle-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Promaretitle-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Promaretitle-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Promaretitle-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1320\" height=\"454\"></figure>\n<p>Studio Trigger made a movie!

They've always tended towards this style, but the Gurren Lagann-meets-Kill la Kill aesthetic of the film really pushes this pretty far. There's extended shots that are nothing but pulsing abstract geometrical shapes, but thru context you still understand what's going on.<br><br>It's also, of course, a standard over-the-top Trigger anime. Trigger has stayed away from its mech anime origins for most of its 8-year existence, but in the last couple years it's gone all in. Promare, Darling in the Franxx, and SSSS.Gridman are all mech anime.<br><br>I have to admit that I might be just a little bit too gay for this show. Oh, it's very gay; its two male leads are very clearly in love with each other, and they even kiss. But I think I related better to some of the more female-driven shows that Trigger's made, especially Little Witch Academia and Brand New Animal. I can't really fault the movie itself, it's damn good, but I know it's resonated more with other audiences.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>GAMES</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>If Found</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-IfFoundtitle.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundtitle-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundtitle-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundtitle-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundtitle-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundtitle-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundtitle-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>I'm legitimately astounded that this game exists.

It is a fascinating mechanic, and they keep finding new twists on it that makes the 2-3 hour length interesting, but... surely there's a reason for it.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-IfFoundimage.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-IfFoundimage-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure><br>It probably has something to do with Kasio's story. Kasio is a trans woman who is rejected by her parents and runs away. She moves into an abandoned house with a young queer band. As she wrestles with her own identity, she's also forced to grapple with how it affects her relationship to her family, her friends, and her larger community.<br><br>I don't know how much of this story is autobiographical. I presume a nonzero amount. It's too accurate to experiences I'm intimately familiar with to be otherwise. Many, many trans people I know have gone thru the sort of familial and community strife and rejection depicted in this game just by coming out. It's also not uncommon for newly out trans people to find a new queer family, which also happens in this game. These are fairly universal experiences for trans people. <br><br>For this story, which is deeply heartfelt in its specifics but also very universal as a trans experience, to be published by a MAJOR independent developer like Annapurna, is honestly so astoundingly wonderful that I don't know how to react. I just want to tell everybody: please play this. It is not very long, and it is wonderful. Playing this with my roommate at 5 in the morning was a deeply emotional experience, and I'll treasure it for a long time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Outer Wilds</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-OuterWildstitle.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-OuterWildstitle-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-OuterWildstitle-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-OuterWildstitle-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-OuterWildstitle-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-OuterWildstitle-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-OuterWildstitle-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>This is another Annapurna Interactive game, and... look, okay, I'm kind of an Annapurna fangirl.

If Found, as I wrote above, was... absurdly wonderful.<br><br>Outer Wilds, what I've played of it so far, is by contrast *merely* an astonishing yet somewhat overwhelming open-world space exploration mystery game. The bar for Annapurna games is so high that \"this is a phenomenal game, and yet it's a little hard for me to get into\" is a step DOWN.<br><br>You play as a (nonhuman) space explorer who lives on a small planet in a small solar system.

I think that's the moment when I realized that this game is an archaeology simulator. It's a mystery game where the way you figure out what's going on is you explore other planets to figure out what happened to the other residents of the solar system, past and present.<br><br>It's not just the time limit that makes this game overwhelming to me. Nearly every location in this game is hazardous in some way. On one planet, an underground labyrinth slowly fills with sand until you're crushed against the ceiling. On another, take a wrong step and you'll fall into a black hole that teleports you into the middle of nowhere. This game is *hard*. <br><br>And there's not a ton of direction it gives you at the outset. Y'know how The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild at least gives you \"go to these four locations and activate the Divine Beasts\" objective, to guide you thru its huge open world? Outer Wilds sort of does that, but... not really. You get a few objectives to go for at the beginning, but the people you find at those objectives just give you some more cryptic clues. It really is up to you to divine the general shape of the game, bounce between exploring various locations, and eventually... well, do something to end the game. It's unclear.<br><br>I haven't finished this game. I don't know *if* I will, to be completely honest. Of the Annapurna games I've played, it's my least favorite. But that's a very relative term. I love the tone, somewhere between chill as heck and dangerous as hell. I love the art style, which seems simple at first but is in fact very carefully designed. I love puttering around the map in my little spaceship, at least until I take a wrong turn and accidentally fall into the sun. This game is... it's a trip, y'all, but I do recommend at least trying it.

The finale to IO Interactive's five-year-long \"World of Assassination\" trilogy. I've put dozens of hours into this series, but until now, I'd actually only played the first few levels of Hitman 1. I like to 100% things, see, and I love getting to know every nook and cranny of a space. That's why I spend so much time with Batman: Arkham Asylum whenever I play it. So I've been spending a good deal of time ferreting out every challenge and everything hidden in the first few levels of Hitman 1.<br><br>When Hitman 3 released, I decided it was time to start playing thru all of the levels, and try each one at least once before returning to my more methodical play style. I've been very very excited about the new levels (including an old mansion murder mystery) and the resolution to the story.<br><br>The thing is, I'm so behind, that this month all I've been able to play so far is the levels of Hitman 1 and 2. That's the Paris mansion, an Italian villa, a Morrocan embassy, a hotel in Bangkok, a farm in Colorado, a high-tech hospital in Japan, a small house on the coast of New Zealand, a racetrack in Miami, a drug cartel in Colombia, the streets of Mumbai, a suburban block in the US, and a secret society's castle island headquarters.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/Jan2021-Hitman3image.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Hitman3image-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Hitman3image-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Hitman3image-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Hitman3image-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Hitman3image-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/11/responsive/Jan2021-Hitman3image-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure><br>The levels in Hitman encourage you to play them thru multiple times; there's just too much to see in a single playthru for you to find it all your first time. But what I learned with this is, playing thru each level of these games once gives you an honestly pretty meaty experience. The final level of Hitman 2 (not counting the DLC) took me two and a half hours to complete. These levels take *time* to play.<br><br>But it's worth it. You honestly get a pretty good experience playing thru it like this; if nothing else, you get to see all the cutscenes between levels in a short period of time, which makes the story a bit easier to follow. It's also a pretty solid difficulty curve. The two US levels in Hitman 2 are pretty easy, and the other levels are all pretty hard, with the final level being the most difficult one.<br><br>I'm excited as heck to play thru these levels again, and start uncovering all their secrets. But before that, in February, I'll be playing the levels that are new to Hitman 3 (plus the Hitman 2 DLC). That's a New York bank vault, an island resort, a Dubai skyscraper, an old English mansion, the streets of Berlin and the streets of China, and... I'm not sure what else. IO Interactive has been very careful about not spoiling the last couple levels of the series. <br><br>But I'm very excited. Very few other games that I've played have this much love put into every single level. There's a huge amount of care and work that's been put into the design of these games, and I'm so glad that IO was actually able to finish the trilogy. Next month, it'll be time for me to finish it, too.</p>\n<p> </p>",

It's fine.<br><br>Halfway thru the series, Namor returns from the Heroes Reborn/Return event, and after a Spider-Man/Namor crossover issue, Spider-Man disappears and the book becomes a Namor team-up book. This part of the series is far more interesting, cause Namor doesn't get his own series all that often. Over the course of four issues, Namor fights off attackers to Atlantis and reclaims the throne. And whereas for the Spider-Man issues, Spidey teamed up with different characters because he was in a different country every month, in the Namor issues the second team-up character keeps changing because nobody can stand to be around him longer than a single issue. I liked having him around, though.

On its own, that's not a particularly bad idea. But the first three-issue arc has been dreadful.<br><br>Besides the specific writing talents of Roger Stern, or lack thereof, I think two factors combined to make Marvel Universe an incredibly dull read. The first was the decision to stretch out each story into a several-issue multi-parter. It's not the only anthology title this year to do so - Journey Into Mystery took the same approach - but it hampers the book's stated ability to jump around and change subject very frequently.<br><br>The second poor choice was to start with a story about the Invaders, an Avengers-style team from the 1940s: Namor, Captain America, and an android Human Torch (predating the Human Torch of the Fantastic Four). I'm always up for more Namor, but at this point I feel like I've read stories about the Invaders SO many times. <br><br>It is kind of cool to see Steve Epting drawing this era here, a few years before he would be called on to draw WWII-era Marvel again for Brubaker's Captain America run in the mid 2000s. But the only new twist Roger Stern can think of for this story is that Baron Von Strucker got access to Doctor Doom's time machine, and uses it to Back-To-The-Future-Part-2 himself some atomic bombs.

Here's Maverick, a guy wearing at least three times as much garishly-colored armor as is necessary, clearly a relic of the grim and gritty mid-90s that's mostly been abandoned by 1998, and Marvel's given him an entire ongoing series of his own. They don't really care about this being friendly to new fans, either - this follows directly from his one-shot in 1997 and his single appearance in the short story compilation X-Men Unlimited, and the cover doesn't really give you an indication of what kind of hero he is. What gives?<br><br>This is exactly the sort of title I should hate, cause grim gritty superheroes and their angst get old REAL fast. But Maverick's plotline is fairly straightforward, and Jorge Gonzales' writing isn't overly wordy, so it's a reasonably breezy read. <br><br>The plot hook for this ongoing series is that cancer-afflicted mutant Maverick suddenly goes into remission and gains new superpowers, giving him a new lease on life. There's a multi-part backup story in which Maverick's young ward gets his own adventures, which is mystifying, because none of this series' characters are memorable at all. Most perplexing of all, though, is the ending. As with many new series, Maverick builds up to a climax in issue twelve, wherein all the main enemies are defeated. But at the end of the issue, Maverick finds himself stranded in a snowy mountain range with no visible hope of rescue.<br><br>This isn't Maverick's last-ever appearance in Marvel Comics - he'll be back in a few years as a regular cast member of Weapon X Vol 2 - but it is his last ongoing series, and presumably the last appearance of his supporting cast, with whom he gets no reconciliation after the bad guys are defeated. If you know it's gonna be your series finale, why not tie it up in a bow? I'm looking at you too, Elektra.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Moon Knight vol 3 #1-4</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Moon-Knight-vol-3-1-4-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1590\" height=\"612\"></figure>\n<p>Here's another title way better than it has any right to be. Character creator Doug Moench is given a four-issue miniseries to resurrect Moon Knight since he was killed in his last adventures.<br><br>The fun part about Moon Knight is the series' questions about belief and identity. It's pretty unclear for most of the series what motivates Moon Knight - is he actually gifted with divine power, or is he deluded? Once he stops asking questions and starts believing in himself, none of that matters anymore.<br><br>I also like that Moon Knight has multiple personalities. This is sort of quietly a thing in a lot of superhero comics - are Bruce Wayne and Batman actually the same person, or are they two distinct personalities? - but in situations where a character explicitly has multiple personalities, they aren't usually written very well. Compare the heroic Moon Knight here to the villainous and murderous Typhoid Mary over in Deadpool, for example.<br><br>Moon Knight is one of the only series this year that made me want to go back and read his older series at some point. The character and the series are haunting and dreamlike and super story-rich, and I dug the fuck out of them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Quicksilver #1-10</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Quicksilver-1-10.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Quicksilver-1-10-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Quicksilver-1-10-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Quicksilver-1-10-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Quicksilver-1-10-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Quicksilver-1-10-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Quicksilver-1-10-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"5352\" height=\"3296\"></figure>\n<p>Quicksilver isn't the kind of mutant I generally give a shit about, and I certainly wasn't looking forward to reading an entire series devoted to him. But luckily the writers cram so much other interesting stuff into the comic that I didn't care that Pietro Maximoff is kinda dull.<br><br>In the very first issue, Quicksilver teams up with the Knights of Wundagore, a group of animals who have been evolved to a more anthropomorphized form and who are capable of speaking English. In other words, this ongoing Quicksilver series has a bunch of furries in it. And they're totally endearing! After this cast is spotlighted in the first few issues, they get their own subplots running thru the background of later issues. I loved them.<br><br>Only four issues in, Quicksilver's wife Crystal (hey look, it's another late 90s married superhero couple!) brings him to meet her Inhuman family at New Attilan on the moon. And this also is a lot of fun - the Inhumans have good visual design and some neat family drama. Also Crystal is just kind of a lovable character.

It turned out to be something kind of different.<br><br>So back in the 1970s, Marvel had an anthology title called Marvel Premiere, which switched up its protagonist on a regular basis. After the release of Star Wars, Marvel looked for ways to cash in on audience appetite for stories in outer space. One of these attempts was Marvel Premiere #41, a self-contained story about a spaceship containing the last of the human race as they flee Earth and its dying sun. This is the issue reprinted in Seeker 3000 Premiere.<br><br>I almost didn't pick this series up, cause it's pretty hard to find. But one of the new series' writers is Dan Abnett, co-writer of a lot of contemporary Marvel cosmic stuff, including the modern reboot of the Guardians of the Galaxy.<br><br>I'm glad I found these issues, cause the writing in Seeker 3000 is good stuff. The plot involves various human and alien factions, but its complexity is contrasted with the ease and humanity with which Abnett writes dialogue. The first issue of the new series is quite long, but it blows by; the characters and their relationships are engaging.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Sensational Spider-Man #25-30</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Sensational-Spider-Man-25-30.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Sensational-Spider-Man-25-30-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Sensational-Spider-Man-25-30-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Sensational-Spider-Man-25-30-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Sensational-Spider-Man-25-30-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Sensational-Spider-Man-25-30-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Sensational-Spider-Man-25-30-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"5996\" height=\"1540\"></figure>\n<p>If you're reading all four Spider-Man books in 1998, Sensational is the first one to come out each month, so it kinda sets the tone for the rest of the month.<br><br>Most Spider-Man comics are about relationships - the character has a huge supporting cast, so his series tend to be even more soap opera-y than other Marvel comics. But I think the most unique thing I can say about Sensational is that it makes Spider-Man's relationships integral to the plot. <br><br>Here's a couple of examples. The identity that writer Todd Dezago comes up with for Identity Crisis is the Hornet, a Beetle-esque persona, and it's enabled via the Prowler's tech. Later on, Dezago's resolution to the Hornet's storyline comes when the Vulture fights him and recognizes that the Hornet is Spider-Man within about two minutes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Silver Surfer vol 3 #135-142</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Silver-Surfer-vol-3-135-142.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-vol-3-135-142-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-vol-3-135-142-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-vol-3-135-142-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-vol-3-135-142-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-vol-3-135-142-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-vol-3-135-142-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"5120\" height=\"3936\"></figure>\n<p>Silver Surfer is J.M.

It's more accessible than Man-Thing, but still tackles some big ideas about the nature of existence thru a superheroic lens.<br><br>I started reading in the arc when Surfer dies and is subsequently brought back to life, though not without tussling with Mephisto. The next two Silver Surfer villains both want to allow humanity to ascend to a higher plane of existence, which basically means turning them into living energy. Surfer is tempted, and is thrown into the Macroverse, a beautifully-rendered plane of existence that allows him to surf across many universes all at once. It's kind of like if an indie director was suddenly given the reins to a blockbuster movie franchise like Star Wars, and it's breathtakingly beautiful at times.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Silver Surfer &amp; Thor Annual 1998</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Silver-Surfer-and-Thor-Annual-1998.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-and-Thor-Annual-1998-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-and-Thor-Annual-1998-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-and-Thor-Annual-1998-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-and-Thor-Annual-1998-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-and-Thor-Annual-1998-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Silver-Surfer-and-Thor-Annual-1998-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"531\" height=\"399\"></figure>\n<p>Rather than slot this annual into DeMatteis' main epic storyline, DeFalco pops in to write this one-off issue wherein Thor and Surfer team up against a cosmic villain.

Spectacular is the only Spider-title to really deal with this plot thread on a monthly basis. It also is the last Spider-title to come out every month, so it had to wrap up both the Spider-Hunt and Identity Crisis events.<br><br>Perhaps relatedly, Spectacular can't manage to keep a consistent writer on the title, at least in the stretch of issues I read. Tom DeFalco, J.M. DeMatteis, Glenn Greenberg, and Roger Stern all contribute to this stretch. It's easily the most uneven Spider-comic of the four (DeMatteis really has a completely different sensibility from the others), but it's still a totally engaging entry in the Spider-Man soap opera, and it's pretty exciting to see Norman Osborn getting potentially closer to his eventualy comeuppance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Spider-Man</strong> <strong>#89-94</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Spider-Man-89-94.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Spider-Man-89-94-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"7696\" height=\"1960\"></figure>\n<p>The adjectiveless Spider-Man title easily takes the most risks of any of the current Spider-Man titles. Howard Mackie's idea for a new identity is Dusk, a moniker that Spider-Man takes on while helping out a rebellion inside the Negative Zone. Dusk allies with supervillain Paste-Pot Pete, making Dusk the most (relatively) antiheroic of the four new Spider-identities.<br><br>Mackie also does a one-off story called \"Who Was Joey Z?\", which sees Spider-Man and Jill Stacy separately investigating the identity of a supervillain's henchman. There's also a really good issue starring Ghost Rider. And all of this is drawn by John Romita Jr., easily one of the best artists of Spider-Man and indeed in all of comics.

It is gross. The Gargoyle story is evocative, especially with its painterly art, and it was very nearly my favorite of the bunch. Unfortunately, there's not much point to the story except to set up an appearance in Silver Surfer.<br><br>So my favorite story in the issue ended up being Cloak &amp; Dagger - perhaps predictable, since I have a soft spot for those two. But it's also the most competently written story - the heroes infiltrate and break up a gang preying on children and bring them to a foster home.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Thor vol 2 #1-2</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/Thor-vol-2-1-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/10/responsive/Thor-vol-2-1-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"349\"></figure>\n<p>It's hard to tell how this title will turn out - so far it's a pretty solid Thor title and not much more.

The hook is this: in the aftermath of Onslaught and the disappearance of major heroes like the Avengers and Fantastic Four, a new team of superheroes called the Thunderbolts appear and quickly come to prominence. These heroes are actually supervillains in disguise, under the direction of Baron Von Zemo. Their plan is to ingratiate themselves to the public just long enough to gain access to secret files only superheroes have access to, and use them to take over the world.<br><br>But here's the twist: in the process of pretending to be superheroes, many of the supervillains find out that they actually do want to reform and be better people. So the question of the book is, now that they've been given this chance, how many of them (if any) will be able to be the heroes they want to be deep down?<br><br>Busiek throws a LOT at these characters in the first twelve issues. They rescue and recruit a young superhero named Jolt who doesn't know that they're supervillains. (This provides the plot hook of the Annual - Baron Von Zemo tells Jolt her teammates' origins, but twists their stories to hide their true nature as villains in disguise.) Black Widow shows up and warns them to stay on the straight-and-narrow, having figured out they're actually villains. They fight off a supervillain team who took their old supervillain team name, the Masters of Evil, which tempts Zemo to reveal themselves.<br><br>And then, merely ten issues in, Zemo learns of discord within the group, and reveals the Thunderbolts' status as \"reformed\" villains to the world, forcing the team to stick by Zemo rather than be caught by the authorities. This plays into the publishing phenomenon I mentioned before where new series usually build to a climax by the end of the first year. By the end of issue twelve, the Thunderbolts have fought and then teamed up with the Avengers, broken free of Zemo's clutches, and gone on the run. <br><br>It's hard to say if the second year is as good as the first, yet. Now under the direction of Moonstone, the Thunderbolts have done some pretty shitty things, including destabilizing an entire planet in order to get back home to Earth. The tension now seems to be whether they can stick together under the manipulative direction of Moonstone, and whether they'll survive an impending conflict with Zemo. But I'm hooked. I love the characters and the premise, I think Busiek does more with this comic than he's doing anywhere else in 1998, and I'm excited to see this team continue on for a hundred more issues. To me, this is the best comic I've read for this project to date.</p>\n<p> </p>",

There's also a lot of many-way-ties on this list. 2020 was a year in which escapism via video game was extremely important to me, so it only felt right to represent the games I played this year appropriately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>1) Sayonara Wild Hearts</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-1-Sayonara-Wild-Hearts-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>This was a game I needed to play this year. I actually tried it on Apple Arcade in 2019, thought it was okay but that the controls were a little tricky, then put it down halfway thru. This year, I tried it on Switch, blazed thru it in a single sitting, loved it, played it again the next day. It hit different this time.<br><br>Sayonara Wild Hearts advertises itself as a pop album you can play. It is a lot of things, but gameplay-wise it is mostly in the style of an endless runner, with occasional segments that mix things up a bit. Sayonara Wild Hearts is also a superhero story, a magical tarot-infused dimension-hopping journey, a game about a protagonist who appears to be nonbinary or genderfluid in some way, and - most importantly - a story about loving yourself, even when it's hard.<br><br>Each group of levels has the player character go up against one or more of the protagonist's exes. But this game wasn't just important to me because I went thru some difficult breakups this year. In 2020, I struggled pretty hard with anxiety and depression, and this message of revolutionary self-love was something I needed to be reminded of. It is a magical musical experience. The songs are pretty damn good too.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>2) Super Mario 3D World</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-2-Super-Mario-3D-World-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>I was up to my ears in Mario stuff this year (more later on in this list). But the game that delighted me the most, I played on a whim on Wii U at the beginning of the year. Super Mario 3D World easily supplants Super Mario Odyssey as my favorite Mario game of all time. The game is creative, colorful, fun, and deeply addictive. The bonus worlds were way too hard for me, but I've got another chance to take them on when the game comes to Switch in 2021, which I couldn't be more excited for.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>3) Hades</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-3-Hades.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-3-Hades-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1158\" height=\"608\"></figure>\n<p>Positions 3 and 4 on this list are two of the only games here that came out in 2020, and they're on everybody else's Game of the Year lists too. I just don't tend to play too many games in the year they're released, unless they're Nintendo games. The only 2020 triple-A game I tried this year was Marvel's Avengers, which left me super disappointed. I do have a hell of a backlog to dig into next year, tho.<br><br>So, Hades. I'm one of the many people who played this game despite not really liking roguelites. And yet I found myself obsessively playing this game for several weeks until I was able to beat the final boss. The game's Greek mythology definitely doesn't hurt; I'm a sucker for Greek mythology, and the gods' and heroes' depiction in this game are fun and vibrant.<br><br>Mostly, I want to highlight just how fun this game is to control. Each of the six weapons behaves slightly differently, especially once you start unlocking their alternate forms. But all of them are very responsive, flashy, and powerful. Even on runs when I didn't get very far into the game, I had a lot of fun playing as Zagreus.<br><br>I do think it's worth noting that I wouldn't have played the game nearly as much - or maybe at all - without the smart structure of unlocking more things as you continue thru the game. More dialogue choices with characters, more aesthetics for your home base, more powers to play with, and even more romance options to pursue. It hits the 100% completion urge I have with some games, and it also means that regardless of skill level, just by playing the game long enough you'll get better. There's a futility to roguelites that I always struggle with - it's why I've never made it past World 1 of Spelunky - but Hades, despite taking place in Hell, doesn't have that. There's always a new toy to play with.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>4) Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-xs.JPG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-sm.JPG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-md.JPG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-4-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>Believe it or not, for a long time I wasn't sure if this would make my GOTY list. It just felt a little too basic. Like, of course Animal Crossing: New Horizons was a good game. Everybody played it, I was obsessed with it for about three months in the spring, but we all moved on eventually. Could I really call it Game of the Year material?<br><br>Every so often I kept coming back to the game to poke at it, but when the snow hit and the winter holidays came around, I got hooked back in again. Maybe it's just cause I really miss snow, or because I've been stuck in my house so long that I missed fashion and style and wanted to try out some new looks among some virtual friends. It definitely helped, too, that Animal Crossing let me hang out with my partner, who finally got a copy of the game.<br><br>There's a ton of people who've made extremely impressive islands, terraforming everything so that their town looks absolutely perfect. I'm a bit more rugged than that, kind of taking things as they come. But Animal Crossing: New Horizons has been a wonderful place to express myself. I've found it's nice to just hang out on the island doing chores cause I get to do it in a cute outfit and a pink haircut.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>5) TIE: Hitman 2 / The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild / <br></strong><strong>Grand Theft Auto V / Batman: Arkham City / Calico</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, position 5 is a five-way tie, and our first tie of the list. There's a lot of ties, so... strap in.<br><br>For a long time, I couldn't decide what would make the fifth position. Nothing stuck out at me as, like, \"Yes, this is definitely the fifth-best game I played this year, for these reasons.\" I loved a lot of games, but there were plenty of games that I dipped into for hours, but never actually finished. Games to just lose myself in for a little while.<br><br>So that's what position 5 now is. The games that let me escape and let myself get totally immersed into another world.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5a-Hitman-2-2-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1894\" height=\"1020\"></figure>\n<p>Let's start with Hitman 2. I've actually been playing levels from Hitman 1, which are available in the (slightly updated) Hitman 2 engine. Hitman levels are a combination of playground, puzzle box, and just a neat place to hang out in and get to know all the nooks and crannies of. I've spent most of my time in Hitman this year getting to know a Parisian mansion hosting a fashion show, and an Italian mansion and the surrounding town that hide a secret laboratory. They've been fun and vibrant locations to master.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5b-TLOZ-BOTW-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>I never finished The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when it first released in 2017. It's an intimidatingly large game. This year, I restarted my save, and came armed with maps and a strategy guide for when I got stuck. They've been a big help to me as I've slowly paved my way thru the game's wilderness. Hyrule is a beautiful world, but I've been glad to be slightly less literally lost in it this time around.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5c-GTA-V.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5c-GTA-V-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1858\" height=\"1039\"></figure>\n<p>I don't have a ton of amazing things to say about the game design of Grand Theft Auto V. The writing is frequently racist and misogynistic, unfortunately. But I don't really play GTA V to interact with its story. I turn the game on to find a car and drive around a city for a little while - indeed, a fictional version of a city I've lived in. In 2020, that's a type of escapism I needed.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5d-Batman-Arkham-City-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure><br>Batman: Arkham City is a game I've played more than once before, but this year I decided to buckle down and complete all of the secret Riddler challenges hidden within the game, and I just about managed it. I didn't get 100%, but I got pretty close, just enough to finish the mission that allows you to capture the Riddler. It was a nice way to get to know one of my favorite games just a little bit better. I tried the sequels for the first time this year too, Arkham Origins and Arkham Knight. They were alright, but I didn't like them enough to get very far. I'll probably try them another year.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-5e-Calico.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-5e-Calico-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1189\" height=\"585\"></figure>\n<p>Finally, Calico was a surprise release on Switch at the end of the year that I absolutely adored. It's a very simple little management sim about running a cat cafe. You do little missions for the nearby town, collect animals and furniture to put in your house, and even collect magic spells and potions. It's just the right blend of queer and magical that made me feel extremely at home.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>6) Coffee Talk</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-6-Coffee-Talk.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-6-Coffee-Talk-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>There's been a few games in recent years that have taken very basic jobs and built an entire game around them. 2013's Papers Please was the first notable recent game to do so, in which you played a border crossing guard and checked people's paperwork. In 2016, VA-11 Hall-A followed, a game in which you play a bartender in a cyberpunk future. Now we have Coffee Talk, in which you play a barista in an alternate universe populated by fantastical creatures such as orcs, elves, and succubi. <br><br>Having worked as a barista, this was the game of the three that made me feel the most at home, since I've basically done this job. Of course the game mechanics are much simpler than the drink recipes at Starbucks, but I appreciated the low-key atmosphere that pervaded this independently run coffee shop. I liked getting to know everybody, and help along their relationships and goals. I guess this was similar to Animal Crossing as a nice way to experience some semblance of regularity and kindness in a year so devoid of it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>7) TIE: The Pirate's Fate / Return of the Obra Dinn</strong></p>\n<p>What can I say?

It takes one of my favorite games, Super Mario Bros. 1, and makes a party game out of it by turning it into a battle royale in which you and 34 other players send enemies to each other to try to eliminate each other and be the last person standing. This was a very fun remix, and way better than Nintendo's last attempt at this format, Tetris 99.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-8d-Lego-Mario.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-8d-Lego-Mario-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></figure>\n<p>Finally, a word about Lego Mario.

I picked up a couple of small sets to create a little interactive diorama of a very Super Mario Bros. 1-esque level, complete with nearly every major enemy from that game, plus a couple extras. Building, playing, and re-designing this level was a lot of fun; Nintendo really did a clever thing by making not just Lego sculptures, but little building kits that let you re-design levels as much as you like.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>9) Nintendo Labo</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-9-Nintendo-Labo-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>\"Okay,\" I said to myself just a month or two before the pandemic began and lockdowns started happening. \"I think it's about time for me to finally try this Labo thing.\" I already made a huge long Christmas post about every toy that's been released for the line so far. But regarding the kits themselves, I'll just say that I usually got more fun out of building these things than playing with them. It reminded me of growing up with Lego kits, and getting really excited about the instructions and how the kits were put together.<br><br>I guess the biggest downside is, now I have to find a place to store all this cardboard.

By the time you're just a few levels in, the Tetris blocks are coming in fast. But I don't really play this game to beat it. I play it to become enraptured once again by the insane audiovisual experience this game has to offer. I'm reminded of Thumper as a similar example of, like... just an insane amount of work that's been put into the music and visuals, not to alter the gameplay at all, but just to make the experience that much more powerful. No wonder both games work so well as VR experiences.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/Game-10b-Just-Shapes-and-Beats.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10b-Just-Shapes-and-Beats-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10b-Just-Shapes-and-Beats-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10b-Just-Shapes-and-Beats-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10b-Just-Shapes-and-Beats-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10b-Just-Shapes-and-Beats-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/9/responsive/Game-10b-Just-Shapes-and-Beats-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>Just Shapes &amp; Beats is the kind of game that I play a few levels of, go away for a while, then come back and replay all the old levels and get just a little bit farther with a few new levels.

I'm extremely impressed by Sakurai and his team at Nintendo, who are continuing to actively support the game over two years into its release.

For all three lists, any media is eligible, regardless of what year it came out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>1) She-Ra &amp; the Princesses of Power</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-1-She-Ra.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-1-She-Ra-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\"></figure>\n<p>My favorite show of all time, Steven Universe, finished up this year. And while that show was a shoe-in for my best show of 2019, it only made it to position 2 this year. Steven Universe in 2019 boasted the end of its regular show, the movie, and the beginning of its epilogue series, whereas Steven Universe in 2020 aired just a few episodes to conclude its run.<br><br>Meanwhile, She-Ra came along this year and absolutely knocked it out of the park. I remember when this show first aired at the end of 2018, and there were tons of moments when I couldn't believe what I was watching. I think I shouted aloud at least once per episode in She-Ra's first season. Because even if She-Ra's queerness isn't as explicit in season 1 as it would be later, the show is absolutely drenched in queer culture. The way characters interact with each other, their dialogue, their jokes, their struggles, the way they see the world, all of it is queer on a very deep level. Watching the first season of She-Ra was mindblowing, because I'd never really seen myself portrayed on TV like that before.<br><br>That was two years ago. Since then, She-Ra's middle seasons have gotten a bit stuck in the weeds of its own plotting. There's been some great moments, episodes, and characters, but nothing as amazing as that first season. Until now.<br><br>She-Ra's final season, which aired this year, was absolutely incredible. Plot developments came fast and frequently. Catra became an actual for-real protagonist just a few episodes in. Her new dynamic with Adora, Glimmer, and Bow was deeply cute. Entrapta, who's slowly solidifed her position as my favorite character over the show's runtime, got a LOT more screentime than last season, when she was pretty much absent.<br><br>Everybody's talking about the kiss in the final episode. It's all over the internet. And yeah, when that happened, I breathed a huge sigh of relief that showrunner Noelle Stevenson actually made it to the finish line on that one. But even before that, I knew that She-Ra had done something special.<br><br>Maybe its middle seasons were a compromised vision, or maybe the writers had a great beginning and ending planned but couldn't find enough interesting stuff to do in the middle. It doesn't matter. What She-Ra brought to the screen stole my heart. I have so much love for its characters, its world, and its unabashed queerness. This show was special.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>2) Steven Universe Future</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-2-Steven-Universe-Future-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>I truly cannot say how special it was that two of my favorite shows, both very queer LGBT cartoons that concluded this year, had nonbinary creators and showrunners. Both of them came out as nonbinary very recently, and it really means a lot that these very visible creators are helping to normalize nonbinary genders.<br><br>So, Steven Universe Future. Only ten episodes aired this year to finish off the journey, but whoof, they were big episodes. This year, Future finally delivered on its promise to follow up on the emotional consequences of the show's events on Steven. He turned into a massive kaiju, got a big climactic hug, then got therapy and found a way forward in his life. Certainly the LGBT community needs to hear that message of hope, and the importance of self-care and leaning on others when you need to, but it's a pretty relatable message for everyone, I think.<br><br>I'm going to miss these characters. Everyone from Steven to Smoky Quartz. But it's also the most fitting ending they could have given them. Sometimes you don't know what happens next, and that's okay. What a thing of beauty the Crewniverse has put out into the world with this show.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>3) The Haunting of Hill House</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-3-Haunting-of-Hill-House-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"524\"></figure>\n<p>I think the highest praise I can give this show is that it had me jumping at shadows for weeks. I had to sleep with the light on until long after we finished it.<br><br>So, first of all: The Haunting of Hill House is a deeply emotional story about family trauma and reconciliation. It has a fascinatingly unusual structure: the events of the story only really take place over a couple of days, and the majority is told in flashback. Every character is put thru the wringer, but this does help each of them to finally understand how the trauma of Hill House affected them, and how to move forward from that.<br><br>The show's cleverest trick, however, is in its easter eggs. At some point while watching the show, viewers will probably start to notice ghosts hiding in the background of shots. No attention is called to them, and they aren't all that relevant to the plot. They're just there, mostly as a way to illustrate how haunted Hill House is. Over time, the background ghosts become so obviously placed that they're impossible to ignore, and you'll spend the rest of the series keeping an eye out for them. I knew about the hidden ghosts going into the series, so I was on the lookout from episode one.<br><br>Last year, I watched a horror movie called It Follows, about a monster that possesses people and constantly, slowly walks towards its victims. This makes the main characters paranoid, as they keep an eye out for anybody walking slowly towards them, but it also makes the viewer paranoid as they watch in the background of shots for any potential suspects. Hill House has exactly the same effect. It makes you paranoid, it makes you look for figures even when there are only shadows. It's the kind of mental conditioning that followed me back into the real world. It was, well, haunting.<br><br>But I wouldn't put a show that traumatized me this high if that trick was all it had up its sleeve. Hill House is filled with good storytelling choices from start to finish. It's pretty hard to watch at times, and I had to force myself to watch episodes that I knew would be on the gorier side, but it was absolutely worth it, and it's a story that'll stick with me for years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>4) Princess Principal</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-4-Princess-Principal.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-4-Princess-Principal-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-4-Princess-Principal-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-4-Princess-Principal-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-4-Princess-Principal-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-4-Princess-Principal-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-4-Princess-Principal-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>Princess Principal is an anime about a group of teenage super-spies in a war-torn and poverty-ravaged Victorian London, from the studio that made the ultra-gay series Flip Flappers. It is *exactly* my shit.<br><br>This one's pretty conceptually simple. Each of the girls has some special ability, each has a tragic background that brought them into their spy group. There's some echoes of Prince and the Pauper with the two leads, who were childhood friends and have found each other again after a long absence as the show's story begins.<br><br>It's presented out of chronological order, but the show is so episodic that it doesn't really matter; each episode is fairly self-contained. The plot almost never matters except as a vehicle to show some cool spy stuff, and mostly to deepen our understanding of the characters and their relationships with each other. Of course there's a train heist, of course there's a daring climax full of twists and double-crosses. All the essentials are here.<br><br>Listen, I'll be honest: spies aren't usually my genre, so this wasn't necessarily going to be a slam-dunk. The thing is, this series is presented as more of a heist show, given the self-contained nature of each mission, and heist shows *are* my genre. But it's more than that. This show has a deep, rich, and yes, very queer heart. The characters stuck with me, and I'll be thinking about this for a while - especially since there's a series of movie sequels planned, which will hopefully begin to wrap up the plot that the studio couldn't quite find a satisfying conclusion to in the show. Not that it matters; the girls have each other, and that's enough.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>5) The Mandalorian</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-5-The-Mandalorian.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-5-The-Mandalorian-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-5-The-Mandalorian-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-5-The-Mandalorian-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-5-The-Mandalorian-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-5-The-Mandalorian-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-5-The-Mandalorian-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"841\" height=\"352\"></figure>\n<p>I probably should have guessed that a show from these creators would be good. Jon Favreau wrote and directed some knockout stories with visual spectacle over the last couple decades, including Iron Man and Zathura. Dave Filoni, meanwhile, cut his teeth working on Avatar: The Last Airbender, and then moved on to be an executive producer on recent animated Star Wars shows The Clone Wars and Rebels.<br><br>But I didn't guess it would be this good. The thing is, The Mandalorian is very basic. Its main two characters (The Mandalorian and The Child) don't even have names for the vast majority of its first season. That first season isn't all that interested in telling a serialized story, and is more interested in telling self-contained stories about their adventures.<br><br>The storytelling in a lot of the first season's episodes are simple, and yet visually rich and subtle, that it feels like an animated show that's been made in live-action. The Mandalorian is a very likable protagonist, and his supporting cast is similarly fun. It's also really cool to me that Mandalorian was a pioneer of TV &amp; film visual effects all on its own. After being burned by Star Wars Episode IX late last year, I was pleasantly surprised to find this show was a much more welcome Star Wars experience.<br><br>I haven't seen the second season yet, although I've been spoiled to heck about it. That's lowered my expectations for the second season quite a bit; the first season had almost no fanfare to it, and was merely a really well-told story.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>6) BNA: Brand New Animal</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-6-BNA-Brand-New-Animal.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-6-BNA-Brand-New-Animal-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-6-BNA-Brand-New-Animal-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-6-BNA-Brand-New-Animal-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-6-BNA-Brand-New-Animal-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-6-BNA-Brand-New-Animal-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-6-BNA-Brand-New-Animal-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\"></figure>\n<p>Earlier this year, I rewatched Little Witch Academia, Trigger's show about a school for witches that aired a couple of years ago. I didn't put it on this list because I've watched it in its entirety before, but this did remind me that, yes, Little Witch Academia is still one of my favorite shows of all time. Just deeply good from start to finish.<br><br>BNA: Brand New Animal, Trigger's follow-up to Little Witch, is substantially less good. If Little Witch was \"let's make an anime out of Harry Potter,\" Brand New Animal is \"let's make an anime out of Zootopia.\" But Little Witch tweaked a lot of elements, clarified some themes, and brought a strong cast of characters to the table. Brand New Animal doesn't really do any of those things.<br><br>Why so high on the list? Well, it's got a shapeshifting tanuki protagonist and a surprising undercurrent of queerness in places, so it's basically my kryptonite. The first two-thirds of the show has a lot of fun concepts for its episodes. The baseball episode went viral immediately, but I related hard to the episode where Michiru made a dolphin friend and went to a human party to pretend to be human together for a night. It just hit at some deeper emotions than I expected.<br><br>I like Michiru's childhood friend-turned-rival, I like the music, I LOVE the visual aesthetic (which is darker and cooler than Little Witch, despite having the same director), and I adore all the transformations. The ending of this show really lets it down, but if you adapt Zootopia without really changing anything, that's gonna happen. BNA is a good reminder that the prey-animals-as-racism-allegory thing really really really wasn't a good idea.<br><br>Honestly, this probably shouldn't be as high as it is, from a more objective critical standpoint. I just liked it a lot, so it gets extra points.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>7) Community</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-7-Community.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-7-Community-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-7-Community-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-7-Community-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-7-Community-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-7-Community-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-7-Community-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2555\" height=\"1431\"></figure>\n<p>This was the year I finally buckled down and watched some of the great live-action comedies of the last few years, which landed at positions 7 and 8 on my list. After dabbling in the series before, and rewatching the Yahtzee episode about half a dozen times, I finally sat down and pretty much binged Community seasons 1-3 in just a few weeks. I tried season 4, I tried hard, but I just couldn't get thru it. Never mind; season 3 gives the show a really excellent ending anyway.<br><br>Community's kind of known for its genre pastiches. The zombie episode, the documentary episodes, the one where they go to space, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons episode, and of course the paintball wars. There's a Halloween special all three years, there's a stop-motion animated Christmas episode, there's a whole lot of jokes about Glee. And yeah, experiencing a lot of this for the first time was very cool. By midway thru season 2, you don't know what you're gonna get when you turn on a Community episode, and that's fun as heck.<br><br>I think what really hooked me on the show was Abed. Because it turns out, a lot of the genre pastiches aren't there just for the fun of it, but because Abed sees the world differently from everybody - as a story, an adventure, a TV episode. The more the study group bonds together, the more they all start to see it too. Community's cast is the most self-aware about their own narratives of any set of characters I've ever encountered. \"I'm doing a bottle episode!\"<br><br>Community is a show about the powers of story and love, and how those two interact with each other. In 2020, that was a story I needed to hear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>8) The Good Place</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-8-The-Good-Place.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-8-The-Good-Place-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>I've watched The Good Place in very small chunks. I saw the first season when it came to Netflix, once the whole season had aired and I'd heard that this was a show worth watching. Early in 2020, I sat down to watch the second season, enjoyed it, and then dropped off again. I almost didn't come back.<br><br>What brought me back to finish the show was The Good Place in even smaller chunks. NBC has been aggressive about putting 3-4 minute segments of the show on Youtube, clips that stand on their own and establish some funny bit of worldbuilding, or that just tell a good joke or share a heartwarming moment. I got a sense of the show's second half in small bits, until finally I relented and finished the whole thing.<br><br>Long before I finished, my roommates and I quoted and referenced the show's mythology verbatim to each other on a regular basis. Things like the Time Knife and Jeremy Bearimy are now common parlance in my household.<br><br>I bring this all up to establish the strength of this show's worldbuilding. Oh, it's coming from a very specific worldview; as my partner pointed out, it's about a group of liberals who rationally argue their way to a better afterlife system. But the world is very fleshed out, if only for comedy purposes, and many of the little details they've come up with are clever and funny.<br><br>As with all of my favorite shows this year, tho, The Good Place wouldn't work half as well without a strong cast of characters. I love Michael and Janet's haphazard attempts at understanding humanity, and I love the earnestness mixed with anxiety that defines Chidi and Eleanor's deep love of each other. When Chidi came to the realization late in the show that The Good Place wasn't really a place, but was just time to spend with your loved ones, I cried. Chidi and Eleanor have a relationship that's good at making me cry.<br><br>This was a rough, rough year. And one of the things that I found the hardest was being reminded of my own mortality and impermanence as the pandemic has continued. And ultimately, amidst all the laughs, The Good Place grapples with death in a sweet and heartfelt way, and it believes in the inherent goodness of humanity.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>9) Zumbo's Just Desserts</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-9-Zumbos-Just-Desserts.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-9-Zumbos-Just-Desserts-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-9-Zumbos-Just-Desserts-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-9-Zumbos-Just-Desserts-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-9-Zumbos-Just-Desserts-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-9-Zumbos-Just-Desserts-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-9-Zumbos-Just-Desserts-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"649\" height=\"364\"></figure>\n<p>I watched a fair bit of reality television this year, from The Amazing Race to The Bachelor. Especially over the summer, I needed some low-effort television to pass the time. Zumbo's Just Desserts surprised me the most with how fun and engaging it was.<br><br>Just Desserts is a dessert-making competition set inside what appears to be a lab from Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, hosted by dessert wizard Zumbo. Each episode is divided into two parts. In the first half, contestants are challenged to create a dessert inspired by a simple prompt, like \"hot and cold\" or \"magical\" or \"kid's birthday.\" In the second half, the two lowest-scoring contestants go one-on-one in a competition to duplicate a dessert designed and crafted by Zumbo himself. This dessert usually has some strange or difficult twist, around a dozen separate components, and intricate detailing. I was particularly fond of an ice cream cone that had all the layers of nachos inside it, and a chocolate hat that melted to nothing under hot liquid.<br><br>As with other reality shows, it's cool to see the contestants' journey over time, and how they change and hone their skills. But more than other reality shows, Zumbo has a gee-whiz \"how did they do that?\" factor that kept me addictively coming back for more. I'm extremely hopeful that once the pandemic lifts, Netflix renews this show for another tasty season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>10) Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/8//responsive/TV-10-Keep-Your-Hands-Off-Eizouken-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1157\" height=\"608\"></figure>\n<p>There were a lot of great opening title sequences in shows I watched this year. Just to name a few, Princess Principal, Brand New Animal, and The Haunting of Hill House all have impressive animated openings with great songs. But Eizouken brought Japanese hip-hop to the party, and easily had the best title sequence of any show I watched this year. I was humming \"Easy Breezy\" as soon as I learned of this show's existence.<br><br>The Japanese title for \"Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken\" translates more literally to \"Don't Mess With The Film Club.\" It follows three high school girls (the story girl, the animator, and the business one) as they realize their dream of making anime. And despite the significant challenges of making anime on a high school budget while also attending classes, they manage to pull it off, establishing their presence as a formidable one - hence the title.<br><br>Eizouken has been called a love letter to a lot of things - anime both general and specific, stories in general, the power of imagination. At least once an episode, the imaginary world intrudes on the real one, and we see the characters not merely designing their creations on paper, but experiencing them on a life-size scale, letting them tinker with their machines like mechanics, and go on wild adventures. The story stays focused on their production of the anime, but the little asides illustrate how these three see the world around them.<br><br>And I appreciated that. It's pretty close to how I interact with the world, where every little thing is potential fuel for a story, or at least for me to imagine what it might be like to live in a place that's a little more fantastical.</p>\n<p> </p>",

It was a sweet and touching, albeit slightly melodramatic, love story involving a lot of body-swapping in the first half. I saw it right when I needed to, as I was figuring out my gender. Makoto Shinkai's follow-up film, released this year, had a lot to live up to.<br><br>I'm shocked to find that Weathering With You is already vying for the top slot as my favorite film of all time, despite having only been released this year. It's also a love story set in a slightly magical Japan, but a lot of what Shinkai was trying to do with Your Name has been tightened up here. While Your Name kluged together a few different plot devices to tell its tale, including body swapping and time travel, Weathering With You tells a much more cohesive story about personal responsibility and love in a time of crisis. My friends found its ending divisive; I found it uplifting. I saw this film in January, but I've been thinking about it ever since, all year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>2) TIE: The Lego Batman Movie / The Lego Ninjago Movie / <br></strong><strong>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part</strong></p>\n<p>I saw The Lego Movie in theaters in 2014, but only this year did I finally get around to seeing the other three films in Warner Bros.' attempt at a Lego cinematic universe.

As I was watching this, I kept thinking of Raiders of the Lost Ark, a movie in which pretty much every single action scene has become iconic. Alan Rickman plays the most deeply fun villain of just about any movie or show I've ever seen, and Bruce Willis is really good in it too.<br><br>It's also a Christmas movie, since that's the main discourse that comes up with this movie now. This movie really wants to remind you every other scene that it's Christmas, and its hero even has a very Christmas-esque change of heart. Overall, I was extremely surprised how well this held up.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>5) 1917</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/Movie-5-1917.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-xs.PNG 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-sm.PNG 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-md.PNG 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/7/responsive/Movie-5-1917-2xl.PNG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"872\" height=\"378\"></figure>\n<p>Well, I only saw two movies in theaters this year, so it's a good thing both of them were good. 1917 feels as much like a very well-produced video game as it does a movie, but at least it's a fun video game, where something interesting is happening most of the time.<br><br>The \"we did this all in one shot\" gag is so obviously constructed that it's hard to ignore that aspect while watching. In contrast, Birdman from 2014 has very very long sequences where it's difficult to tell if there was a cut, and the performers just had to memorize huge pieces of dialogue and just go for it. There was an innate tension in Birdman because I just couldn't believe that the camera was still rolling. 1917 feels very artificial in comparison.<br><br>And yet... well, it has some really standout performances that raise this movie above its gag. It's thinly written, but moments from the film still haunt me, and that's exactly what a World War I movie should do. \"I had hoped today would be a good day,\" says one character. Big 2020 mood, y'all.</p>\n<p> </p>",

It's also the most versatile to play with in the Vehicle Kit open world map. (Just generally speaking, I adore the little exploration game that comes with Vehicle Kit.) This is one of the best. <strong>A+</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>1) VR Goggles</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2049\" height=\"1536\"></figure>\n<p>I'm surprised how well this works. Legitimately. I'm also surprised just how much there is to do with this gadget, both by itself and with the other gadgets in the kit. This kit feels like they put the most work into providing games for you to do, and every one of them uses the VR goggles. Plus this gadget is usable in at least four other Nintendo-published games. <strong>A+</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>\n<p>And that's it! That's the whole set. I will say, this was a nice way to pass the time this year. I'd recommend these if you have a Switch and don't mind building a little bit.</p>\n<p>In case you're wondering which Kit to get, here's my thoughts on the four.</p>\n<p><strong>Robot Kit</strong> has a very complex build and a pretty simple game. Do not start here.</p>\n<p><strong>Variety Kit</strong> is a nice introduction to the Labo kits, with low replay value but some neat gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Vehicle Kit</strong> has one single game and just a few larger gadgets that they've put a lot of effort into. I'm not sure how well it works as a starting point, but it's a solid set overall.</p>\n<p><strong>VR Kit</strong> has a gentle learning curve, some of the neatest builds of the bunch, a huge amount of replay value with the included games, and compatibility with several other Nintendo-published Switch games. It's my favorite set of the four.</p>\n<p>Happy building!</p>",
