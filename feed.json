And liked it a lot. This is gonna sound weird, but this is the game that made me understand why Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the most revered game developers of all time. DK Jr., like most of the arcade titles of the time, is a single-screen game. And yet each level feels like a multi-tiered adventure. You have to dodge and weave back and forth across the screen, thru different types of zones, to get to the top. It's neat as hell how much is squeezed into this.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>POPEYE<br></strong>Arcade<br>Played on NES</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/Popeye-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Popeye-2-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Popeye-2-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Popeye-2-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Popeye-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Popeye-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Popeye-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"516\"></figure>\n<p>Finished this one. Unlike the DK series, this game is about running around collecting things that Olive is throwing at you. But like those games, there's just a few stages, so with a little effort you can get to an ending. And I liked this, it's a bit basic but it's pretty cute.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>1983</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>JETPAC<br></strong>ZX Spectrum<br>Played on Xbox One</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/Jetpac.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Jetpac-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Jetpac-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Jetpac-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Jetpac-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Jetpac-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Jetpac-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"565\" height=\"428\"></figure>\n<p>First game in the Rare Replay catalog. I wasn't expecting much from a 1983 ZX Spectrum game, but this is fun to play, has clear objectives, controls surprisingly well, and runs really smoothly. You play as an astronaut with a little jetpack trying to put his ship together and fill it with fuel while avoiding aliens. I guess my biggest gripe is that your shooting radius sucks so it's hard to shoot at aliens that are coming for you at an angle. I didn't feel compelled to play a lot of this, but it's a lot more fun to play with than I expected.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>MARIO BROS.<br></strong>Arcade<br>Played NES port on Switch<br>Played on GBA</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/Mario-Bros.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Mario-Bros-xs.jpg 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Mario-Bros-sm.jpg 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Mario-Bros-md.jpg 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Mario-Bros-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Mario-Bros-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Mario-Bros-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"594\" height=\"442\"></figure>\n<p>You play as Mario (&amp; Luigi) running around a single screen trying to defeat various enemies. The original (well, the NES port) has absolutely terrible physics. That surprised me. All the other Mario/DK series ports have been pretty decent to control so far, but Mario just does not behave the way you expect him to here, and so I couldn't get very far. Then I popped a GBA port of the game in and it controlled a LOT better, I got a lot farther, and I had a lot more fun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>BOMBERMAN<br></strong>PC<br>Played on NES</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/Bomberman-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Bomberman-2-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Bomberman-2-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Bomberman-2-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Bomberman-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Bomberman-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Bomberman-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"559\"></figure>\n<p>I don't think I can make it thru all 50 levels of Bomberman. It feels like there's a lot of randomness inherent: the enemy movements aren't completely predictable, and the hidden exit location is hidden in a random location each time. Maybe you'll get lucky and get the exit right away, or maybe it'll take you a while. Bomberman moves slowly and the bombs are less powerful than I expected. I started out sort of annoyed by this game.</p>\n<p>But I dunno, something about it is really compelling. Maybe the search, and the slight unpredictableness of the hunting down enemies, are both inherently enough to make me go \"maybe THIS time I've got this.\" Maybe the randomness is low enough that I keep thinking I'll be able to find a new strategy that'll lower it. It's kind of like Minesweeper but with enemies, and that's a pretty good way to improve Minesweeper. I could see myself sinking a lot of time into this, and I had a hard time pulling myself away from it. No wonder they made so many sequels.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>DONKEY KONG 3<br></strong>Arcade<br>Played NES port on Switch</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/Donkey-Kong-3.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Donkey-Kong-3-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Donkey-Kong-3-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Donkey-Kong-3-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Donkey-Kong-3-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Donkey-Kong-3-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Donkey-Kong-3-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"603\" height=\"436\"></figure>\n<p>Growing up, this was my favorite of the main Donkey Kong games, maybe cause it's just so different. Something about pushing Kong up with the pesticide is really satisfying.</p>\n<p>Now, it's still fun, but it's not as structured as the other Miyamoto games I've played so far, so there isn't really as much of a sense of pacing. I can't really get to a point where I feel like I've finished DK3. The stages loop, but not always quite in the same order, and it keeps adding new insect types. Pacing-wise it's more similar to Bomberman or Mario Bros.</p>\n<p>Nothing wrong with that!

I mean, how much sports strategy can you actually simulate with a D-pad and two buttons?</p>\n<p>Now, baseball games are LONG, and unlike some other sports games where you can speed the clock up so it'll take less time, there's no real way to speed up a baseball game. You gotta sit thru the whole thing. But that's kinda weirdly relaxing in a way. There's a rhythm to it, and there's time for some real drama. Usually what happens in these is I make some colossal fuck-up partway thru cause I pushed the wrong button, and then I spend the rest of the game trying to fix my mistake, to no avail.</p>\n<p>There's different ways to pitch (is there strategy to that? I can certainly pretend there is), and a little bit of skill to when to hit and when to run. And that's just about as much input as I need in an 8-bit baseball game. I've tried RBI Baseball (also for NES), where you actually have to make the runners run thru the outfield, and that was painful. But this kind of works.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>DONKEY KONG JR.

It's a very very early top-down shooter, and I'm honestly completely fine with skipping it over.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>LUNAR JETMAN<br></strong>ZX Spectrum<br>Played on Xbox One</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/Lunar-Jetman-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Lunar-Jetman-2-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Lunar-Jetman-2-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Lunar-Jetman-2-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Lunar-Jetman-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Lunar-Jetman-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Lunar-Jetman-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"606\" height=\"484\"></figure>\n<p>This game is upsettingly unfair. It's the sequel to Jetpac, and like that game, features a player character with a jetpack, and alien creatures/debris (?) that travels very fast in diagonal lines.</p>\n<p>In Jetpac, you could kind of strategize because the aliens (and you) can loop around the screen, so you could see things coming and avoid them. Here, you're on a more linear surface, and the flaws in the game's design become clear immediately.</p>\n<p>Your pea-shooter gun has no range, so if something's flying at your face but your gunfire is just a little too low, it'll kill you anyway. The aliens move extremely quickly, and your walking speed is very slow, so there's no way to effectively dodge.</p>\n<p>The game sees you piloting a lunar rover across a planetary surface, and every time there's a pothole you have to get out and patch the hole. But if you are hit by something and die, another pothole gets created, which creates an infinite loop (until you run out of lives).</p>\n<p>Jetpac is a totally decent arcade game. This sequel is just deeply frustrating.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>ATIC ATAC<br></strong>ZX Spectrum<br>Played on Xbox One</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/Atic-Atac-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Atic-Atac-2-xs.png 300w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Atic-Atac-2-sm.png 480w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Atic-Atac-2-md.png 768w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Atic-Atac-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Atic-Atac-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/3/responsive/Atic-Atac-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"483\"></figure>\n<p>Third Rare game for the ZX Spectrum. This is another fascinating little oddity. If it was the only game I owned, or I cared more about it, I'd probably go ahead and keep throwing myself at it until I solved it.</p>\n<p>You play as one of three character types (knight, wizard, serif) in a top-down format as you try to escape from a haunted house. There's monsters, keys, and secret passageways. Aesthetically, it's one of my favorite of the bunch so far.</p>\n<p>I'm reminded of 2D Zelda dungeons, but if I had, like, no map or sense of where I was supposed to go, and also if the dungeon was extremely large. It also reminds me of Binding of Isaac, where your ability to progress early on is pretty random. If I was patient, I could probably map the game out, but the game has a timer and respawning enemies that push you along, so you kinda only get a sense of what's going down in spookytown.</p>\n<p>I like the visual design, which is a weird thing to say for the janky-ass graphics of the Spectrum. I'll definitely come back to it. But this is definitely a bit too obtuse for me to enjoy playing for too long at a time.<br><br><br></p>",

Reading every Marvel comic of the last 20 years, playing thousands of Nintendo games stretching over the entire history of the medium.</p>\n<p>And I have some thoughts about these things. Quite a lot of them, actually.</p>\n<p>This is a place where I'm keeping all of my thoughts. It's a personal journal so reviews won't necessarily have in-depth analysis. B<span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">ut hey, if these are interesting to anybody to read, that's pretty cool too.</span></p>\n<p>Here are the media projects I'm currently working on, and what they mean.</p>\n<p>MARVEL COMICS: The last 20-ish years of Marvel Comics have changed the face of superhero media, and media in general. Also, I just generally love Marvel in general. The Marvel project, currently, is to read just about every issue of Marvel Comics starting around the turn of the millennium.</p>\n<p>SHONEN JUMP: Midway thru 2020, I decided to catch up with all the currently running series in Weekly Shonen Jump. I'll post my thoughts on the series as I go thru them.</p>\n<p>HISTORY OF VIDEO GAMES: This one's a bit harder to explain, but basically: I missed most video games growing up, and there's a lot I want to get to. I put together a timeline of video games that starts with every game represented in the Super Smash Bros. series (which includes a lot of the classics in some way), and then expanded with a few other collections and oeuvres, like recent Bethesda and Eidos Interactive games, plus Rare Replay, recent mini consoles, etc. Thru this project, I will play as many of these games as I can. Anything I can't find at all, I'll at least try to track down some footage to get an idea.</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy!</p>",
