I read a lot of manga this year, but the majority of it was digitally via the Shonen Jump app; that manga will be covered in its own separate list. There were a few manga that I picked up physical copies of and read on its own; those will be covered here.</p><p>Graphic novels &amp; physical manga are counted as books for this list's purposes, partly because I didn't read a huge number of prose books this year. Also, there wasn't a single book bad enough to qualify for a "worst of the year" list.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>#1</strong></p><p>Of all these lists, this was the easiest #1 slot to give out by far. How could it be anything but <strong>The Anthropocene Reviewed</strong>? This is a book I'll carry with me for a long time.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/01anthreview.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/01anthreview-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/01anthreview-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/01anthreview-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/01anthreview-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/01anthreview-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/01anthreview-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="298" height="450"></figure><p>Having now written five novels and co-written an additional two, John Green here turns to nonfiction. The Anthropocene Reviewed is an idea John had for grading various aspects of the human experience on a five-star scale, like Diet Dr. Pepper, the Lascaux Caves, Halley's Comet, and Humanity's Capacity for Wonder.<br><br>The Anthropocene Reviewed began life as a podcast, and has now been turned into a book. And full disclosure: I haven't finished it yet. The essays in Anthropocene are usually just a few pages, but they are emotionally weighty and incredibly beautiful. They're hard to binge. You read one, sit with it, and come back later and read another one.<br><br>I don't stop that from letting me review and rank this book of reviews myself, though. (One of my favorite books of all time is a French tome called "How To Talk About Books You Haven't Read," which I have of course never finished.)<br><br>Over the last two years, it feels like humanity as a species has had a collective crash course in our own mortality. It's been so easy to be confronted with the terrible parts of the world, that sometimes a little beauty and hope is a necessary and healing thing. And The Anthropocene Reviewed is that book, partly written during the pandemic and thus seemingly a direct counter to some of that hopelessness.<br><br>I cannot honestly describe The Anthropocene Reviewed as anything other than a spiritual experience. A series of loosely connected essays becomes a story about our world, ourselves, and the relationship between those two things. As this and other sources have reminded me so long, we are not separate from the world, but part of it. "What a blessing to be Earth loving Earth."</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>#2</strong></p><p>There's quite a few standalone graphic novels I read and enjoyed this year; it's a seemingly very healthy market, and frequently a queer one as well. And my best graphic novel experience of the year was <strong>Girl Haven</strong>.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/02girlhaven.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/20/responsive/02girlhaven-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="288" height="426"></figure><p>I bought Girl Haven on a whim, because a friend got it and heard it was good, and I was looking for good books earlier in the year. Girl Haven just so happened that I received it the weekend I also received my vaccine. The vaccine shot knocked me on my ass for two days, and it was hard to do very much other than lie around. But Girl Haven was a quick read and mostly pictures, so I could at least read that.<br><br>Girl Haven is one of the best depictions of gender questioning and coming out as trans that I have read in a piece of mainstream media. Ash is a young boy whose mother disappeared into another dimension three years prior. When Ash and his friends find their way into that dimension, they find that this world is a world where only girls live. And yet somehow Ash was able to arrive here - so what does that mean for him?<br><br>There are a lot of trans coming-out stories that involve fate intervening to alert the main character that they might not be the gender they thought they were. It's a common fantasy among trans people to time travel back in time and tell your younger self what's going on, to avert years of heartache and confusion. But where Girl Haven becomes really special for me is how it subverts this expectation. Not long after arriving, Ash and his friends actually do find a group of boys who think that Ash could be their prophesized king and savior. So while the initial trip to this "girl haven" helped Ash to start questioning things, the story ultimately positions itself so that Ash has to be the one to do the work and make the decision for himself about what gender to be - and, indeed, Ash ends up coming out as a girl in the climax.<br><br>Girl Haven is a sweet book, and the best thing it could do would be to be that introduction to a new world that other young trans people might need, which Ash is lucky enough to receive. In my case, I found the story deeply relateable, smartly told, and resolved really sweetly. I highly recommend it.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 6, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/tags/best-of-the-year/">Best of the Year</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/authors/harmony/" class="invert" rel="author">Harmony</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/best-and-worst-tv-of-2021.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Best (&amp; Worst) TV of 2021</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-01-05T18:31" class="feed__date">January 5, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/best-and-worst-tv-of-2021.html" class="invert">Best (&amp; Worst) TV of 2021</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-01-04T20:05" class="feed__date">January 4, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/best-movies-of-2021.html" class="invert">Best (&amp; Worst) Movies of 2021</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-01-03T16:02" class="feed__date">January 3, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media-journal-best-games-of-2020.html" class="invert">Media Journal: Best Games of 2020</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
