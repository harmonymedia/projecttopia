Hopefully that won't happen again, but I wouldn't be surprised if it does. This project involves going thru a lot of games.<br><br>I strongly considered cancelling this project, just cause of how many games per month this project entails. But the thing is, I've found some of my favorite games ever in Humble, as you'll see below. So I do think it's worth keeping around for now.<br><br>With that preamble out of the way, here is a rundown of the games in Humble's monthly bundles for February 2021 and February 2016, ranked from best to worst.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>HUMBLE FEBRUARY 2021 BUNDLE</strong></p><p class="align-center"><strong>1) Werewolf The Apocalypse: Heart of the Forest</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-title-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>This is the first game in any 2021 bundle that I've played thru to completion, just to give you a sense of how much I liked it.<br><br>Werewolf: The Apocalypse is a tabletop roleplaying game in the same universe as Vampire: The Masquerade. Both are storytelling-heavy systems in which you play as a member of a secret clan of monster people. These games are SO much more narratively-focused than Dungeons &amp; Dragons that it makes a lot of sense to translate these systems in a videogame sphere to something more linear like a visual novel.<br><br>Last month, VTM: Shadows of New York mixed good art and deep writing to create a rich visual novel experience. This month, WTA: Heart of the Forest is doing the same thing, but a little bit better.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/WTA-Heart-of-the-Forest-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>In both games, you play as a queer girl trying to find herself. Whereas in VTM: Shadows of New York you played as a down-on-her-luck investigative journalist, here you play as a girl just trying to find her heritage in the depths of Poland. Along with her friend, she travels to a town she's seen in her dreams, and the mystical forest and strange townspeople slowly help her understand her nature as a newborn werewolf.<br><br>One of my critiques of these visual novels is this: in translating a robust tabletop roleplay system, there's a lot of ideas and definitions the game needs to inorganically teach you. Shadows of New York did this by throwing definitions at you every couple of minutes, but Heart of the Forest solves this problem rather elegantly with its best gameplay decision: an honest-to-Gaia in-game character sheet.</p><p>As you progress thru the game, the decisions you make slowly build your character sheet. Your relationship with various characters is recorded, as are all your stats. Depending on what actions you take, you can gain or spend points in all sorts of areas.<br><br>This also means that the game *feels* more interactive than Shadows of New York. I'm unsure how much your choices actually change the story, but the writing tweaks itself to what your character cares about and how they're feeling.<br><br>I dunno, something about the Werewolf setting, which is very much about being an environmental activist, resonates with me more than the Vampire setting, which is more generically about being part of a monstrous secret society. This game really grabbed me, I loved the main character I built, and it was a treat to see this story to the end. I'd happily play a sequel.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>2) Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Trine-4-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-title-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>I'm sort of surprised they're still making Trine games. Trine has been around since the beginning of the indie boom in the late 2000s. It's a series of 2.5D puzzle platformers (that is, 2D platformers where the grapics are rendered in 3D). The third installment supposedly took a detour into 3D platforming, but after that was received poorly, Trine 4 is back to the 2.5D formula the series began with.<br><br>This is the only Trine game I've ever played with, so I can't really get a sense of how similar or different it is to the other games, or if the narrative really needed a fourth installment. Certainly the plot reads as a standalone "our established heroes must embark on a one-and-done quest" kind of thing.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Trine-4-gameplay-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Trine-4-gameplay-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>All I can tell you is that this game plays very well. The puzzle platforming is not terribly difficult, but it is very engaging. I keep wanting to play just a little bit more to see what's around the corner.<br><br>And it is a BEAUTIFUL game. Seriously, the art design in this game is absolutely stunning. Even if the game is a somewhat shallow experience, it's a very well-made shallow experience.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>3) Train Station Renovation</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Train-Station-Renovation-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-title-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>What is it with me and job simulator games? Train Station Renovation is a game in which you go to old decrepit train stations, and you clean them up. That's the whole game, and it rocks.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Train-Station-Renovation-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>It's not as good as PC Building Sim, for a few reasons. The music's not as good, for one thing, and in a long meditative game that's an important factor. Also, the process of cleaning up a train station is somewhat inherently longer than that of cleaning up a PC, which means that I don't really see the game progress and evolve here. A single game session of Train Station Renovation will probably include only one station, whereas a single session of PC Building Sim could see me work with at least half a dozen computers.<br><br>But ultimately, none of that matters too much, because the gameplay loop of Train Station Renovation is just inherently deeply satisfying. It even lets you customize the look of your train stations! What more could you really ask for?</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>4) Co-Open</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Co-Open-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-title-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>This month's Humble Original is a fascinating little game. You play as a small child, and your parent has brought you to the grocery store. Your job is to collect and purchase groceries, by yourself, for the first time ever. Once you've selected seven items, you can bring them to the register and pay for them. Then your parent will pick you up and take you home.<br><br>You'd think there'd be some kind of structure to the game, maybe a list of groceries you're supposed to collect. But nope. The dialogue in the ending cutscene will change depending on what you've bought, but no matter what your parent will be pleased with your choices. What you buy is completely up to you.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Co-Open-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Co-Open-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>Surely that can't be the whole game, I thought. So I booted it up a second time. And it turns out I was right! There is a little bit more to the game. But not much, and it's not explicitly structured. If you wander around, you'll find other characters perusing the aisles. You can also find other secret areas, both inside and outside the building. All of these give you other characters to talk to, and little sidequests for you to try. You'll get a little reward to collect if you complete them. And as soon as you're done, you check out at the grocery store and your parent will pick you up.<br><br>There's really nothing pushing you to play more, besides the "collections" screen in the main menu that shows you all the achievements you've unlocked. It's just a cozy, well-made little grocery store simulator, with just a bit more exploration and sidequests than you might expect. And I think it's really sweet. You really feel the wonder and overwhelm of being a small child in this situation.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>5) Iris &amp; the Giant</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Iris-and-the-Giant-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-title-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>A game in which you proceed thru the Greek underworld, killing monsters, based on randomly generated powers. No, this isn't Hades. It's a sweet little game called Iris &amp; the Giant, in which you play an outcast high school girl who battles her way thru leagues of warriors in the underworld.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Iris-and-the-Giant-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>The gimmick here is that you can only do actions from a deck of cards that you draw randomly from: sword, shield, bow and arrow, axe, health pickups, and more are all drawn from your deck of actions. I THINK this is sort of similar to Slay the Spire?<br><br>It's very very simple. But this works. Other than the flavor, the other way this game parallels Hades is that you get little bonuses each time you play that make the game a little easier each time. I'm always curious what else I'm going to find around the next corner, and so I keep coming back.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>6) Outward</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Outward-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-title-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>This is a very odd one. I'm not sure I'd call anything at this position or below a really good game. But Outward is absolutely fascinating.<br><br>Outward is a third-person fantasy RPG. But at some point, the developers of this game said, "what if we also made this a survival game?" And then they leaned really really hard on that aspect of the game, making Outward an odd fusion.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Outward-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Outward-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1916" height="1078"></figure><p>I'd almost call Outward a roguelike. On my first playthru, I woke up with the villagers mad at me and threatening to take away my lighthouse home unless I paid them off. So I started wandering around the village looking for supplies, and then I fell off a cliff. "Okay," I thought, "surely this game has autosave, and I can try again." Nope! I woke up in an inn, having slept off my injuries for several days. When I returned to my lighthouse, the window for that quest had passed, and I'd already lost my home.<br><br>Further playthroughs were really similar. I'd try to do something, encounter some strange catastrophe that completely derailed my plans, and then the game would just continue and I was expected to muddle things out. You get to a point eventually where it just makes more sense to start over, but every time I played I learned a little bit more about how the world worked, and where important things were on the map, and stuff like that.<br><br>I don't think this is very good game design. It's very frustrating to play at times. But I've never played a game quite like this, either, and I sort of have to respect this game giving me a singularly unique game experience.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>7) Valkyria Chronicles 4</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-title-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>This series wants to be Fire Emblem so fucking bad, y'all.<br><br>I played a bit of the first game years and years ago. (It's actually part of the first-ever Humble Monthly in November 2015.) It's a turn-based tactics game like Fire Emblem, but the gimmick is that every time you move a character, the game turns into a third-person shooter, and you can freely move and shoot wherever you like.<br><br>Lo and behold, about a decade after the first game's release, Valkyria Chronicles 4 is essentially the same game.

This is effectively a direct sequel to Valkyria Chronicles 1, and it's a standalone story either way, so its connections to previous games don't really matter.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-gameplay-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-gameplay-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-gameplay-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-gameplay-2-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-gameplay-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-gameplay-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Valkyria-Chronicles-4-gameplay-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>I had to *struggle* to get past the cutscenes. The game takes place in an anime knockoff version of World War II, which is already cloying enough. The characters are all stereotypes. But here's the worst part: Valkyria Chronicles often has multiple cutscenes in a row, and between cutscenes it will boot you back to the main menu and force you to select the next one. And then confirm that yes, I'm really sure I want to watch it. It's exasperating.<br><br>I'm surprised this game ranked this high. But once you actually get into a battle, if you can ignore the story and characters, there's some interesting and decently fun tactics experiences. I threw all my soldiers at a challenge and got a lot of them killed, and then had to hold out while I waited for reinforcements. That was a tense little sequence, and it's the only situation in which VC4 provided any sort of unique experience.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>8) Boomerang Fu</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Boomerang-Fu-title.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Boomerang-Fu-title-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>This is a pretty decent party game.

That's the whole thing.<br><br>Moving around, using the boomerang, picking up powerups... at a basic level, playing this game feels pretty good. It's frantic, but not too out-of-control.

I was about equally matched with my CPU opponent on my first playthru, and the CPU ended up winning. But I noticed that while I would haphazardly throw my boomerang around and then go running for it, the CPU kept running up and slicing my throat.<br><br>So on a second playthru, I tried using the boomerang as just a generic melee weapon, like a sword or knife. And lo and behold, that worked way better. Maybe cause there's no way implemented to aim or lock-on with the boomerang, it's sort of frustrating to use as a throwing implement, and there's a lot less x-factor in a big brawl if you just run around and stab people.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><strong>9) Lovecraft's Untold Stories</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Lovecrafts-Untold-Stories-title-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>What if Spelunky was a top-down 2D exploration game, and also it was themed around Cthulhu cultists and other Lovecraft references?

But on its own terms, I think this works great.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Broken-Age-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-gameplay-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Broken-Age-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>I<span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> think the story of kids trying to break out of the abusive cycles their parents inflicted onto them is still really relevant. I think the gimmick is great: both characters have their own self-contained stories and environments in the first half, and then they switch places, leading to interesting new puzzles and interactions in the second half's remixed areas. </span></p><p>The last big sequence of the game is still a pretty bullshit puzzle, to be sure.

How far the mighty have fallen. I think this game was really well received, years and years ago. Certainly I remember it being... at least intriguing, although I never got very far. This is a pixelly indie game, very much in the style of early indie games like Fez and Superbrothers, in which you play a small warrior with a bow and arrow, trying to destroy several bosses. There is no level design outside the bosses. It's just a boss rush game.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/Titan-Souls-gameplay.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/14/responsive/Titan-Souls-gameplay-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><p>So those bosses gotta be pretty well-designed for this to work, and let me tell you, I could not finish a single boss in this game. Your movement controls don't work great, and you have to summon your single arrow back to you every time you fire it. You also only have a single hit point; if you get hit once, you die and have to try the boss again. If you're really good at boss fights, this might be for you, but it's way too difficult for me.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 13, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/tags/humble-monthly/">Humble Monthly</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/authors/harmony/" class="invert" rel="author">Harmony</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/marvel-comics-first-half-of-1998-part-4.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Marvel Comics: First Half of 1998, Part 4</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/weekly-shonen-jump-rundown-march-2021.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Weekly Shonen Jump Rundown: March 2021 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-02-04T23:54" class="feed__date">February 4, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/humble-monthly-bundle-january-20212016.html" class="invert">Humble Monthly Bundle: January 2021/2016</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
