A decently fun little fishing game, too.

It looks very impressive, and the way it uses haptic feedback is pretty clever. Probably the best part of the blaster is the shooting game is the most visually impressive of the Kit.

First of all, the build has some odd angles that don't seem like they should be physically possible with cardboard. Second, the toy is compatible with two other toycon (the Pinwheel and the Wind Pedal) to improve the experience. Third, the wings are cleverly designed to give you a blast of air while you're playing. But best of all, this lets you play the coolest game in the VR Kit, an open-world exploration that lets you fly around an island in VR. It's easily one of the most fun experiences in a standout kit. <strong>A</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>3) Piano</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/Piano-with-Joycon.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/Piano-with-Joycon-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure><p>I haven't actually played with this very much. I don't think it has much staying power as a toy. It does have a decently robust music creation suite, but it's a little too much for me to figure out.<br><br>However, it's easily my favorite *looking* toycon, it is one of the most impressive in features, and I keep it out on display constantly.

It has a huge number of features, maybe more than any other individual toycon, and it's easy to pop the lid off the thing and look at them. It's also the most versatile to play with in the Vehicle Kit open world map. (Just generally speaking, I adore the little exploration game that comes with Vehicle Kit.) This is one of the best. <strong>A+</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>1) VR Goggles</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-md.jpg 768w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media/posts/6/responsive/VR-Goggles-With-Joycon-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="2049" height="1536"></figure><p>I'm surprised how well this works. Legitimately. I'm also surprised just how much there is to do with this gadget, both by itself and with the other gadgets in the kit.

Plus this gadget is usable in at least four other Nintendo-published games. <strong>A+</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p><p>And that's it! That's the whole set. I will say, this was a nice way to pass the time this year. I'd recommend these if you have a Switch and don't mind building a little bit.</p><p>In case you're wondering which Kit to get, here's my thoughts on the four.</p><p><strong>Robot Kit</strong> has a very complex build and a pretty simple game. Do not start here.</p><p><strong>Variety Kit</strong> is a nice introduction to the Labo kits, with low replay value but some neat gadgets.</p><p><strong>Vehicle Kit</strong> has one single game and just a few larger gadgets that they've put a lot of effort into. I'm not sure how well it works as a starting point, but it's a solid set overall.</p><p><strong>VR Kit</strong> has a gentle learning curve, some of the neatest builds of the bunch, a huge amount of replay value with the included games, and compatibility with several other Nintendo-published Switch games. It's my favorite set of the four.</p><p>Happy building!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 28, 2020</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/authors/harmony/" class="invert" rel="author">Harmony</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/marvel-comics-first-half-of-1998-part-2.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Marvel Comics: First Half of 1998, Part 2</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/media-journal-best-movies-of-2020.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Media Journal: Best Movies of 2020 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://harmonymedia.github.io/projecttopia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
